[{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today that it had suspended the registration of Ms Hui Shan Shan (Hui), a dealer’s representative under the Securities Ordinance (SO), for four months effective from 10 February 2000.\n\nThe action stemmed from an inquiry covering the period 22 June 1998 to 28 July 1998 during which Hui was employed by Core Pacific-Yamaichi International (HK) Limited (CPYI) and Core Pacific-Yamaichi Securities (HK) Limited (CPYS). She has since left their employment.\n\nThe Commission found that Hui had, in a share placement, given assurances to her clients about the future price of the stock which were without foundation and were not the subject of proper analysis. The Commission considered that Hui had been reckless in her recommendations to clients and had therefore not acted in the best interests of clients and without proper regard to the integrity of the markets.\n\nThe SFC also found that Hui’s conduct occurred whilst her application for registration as a dealer’s representative accredited to CPYI was awaiting approval by the SFC.\n\nAs a result of the above findings, the SFC concluded that Hui’s conduct seriously impugned her fitness and properness and decided to suspend her registration for four months. In deciding on the period of suspension the SFC took into account that Hui had been out of the securities industry since the end of May 1999.\n\nA SFC’s spokesman, commenting on the case said that \"in recommending investment opportunities to clients, registered persons must ensure that such advice is only given after careful consideration and based on proper analysis. It is unacceptable conduct for a registered person to make recommendations or promises as to future performance without any proper basis. Any registered person who fails to meet such standards can expect the SFC to view his conduct most seriously.\"","known_entities":"Hui Shan Shan|Shan Shan Hui"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today that it had publicly reprimanded K.K.M. Securities Limited (KKM), its dealing director, {X1}, and two of its dealer's representatives, {X2} and {X3}, under the Securities Ordinance. \n\nThe action stemmed from an investigation in which it was found that a dealer's representative and a settlement clerk of KKM had extensively dealt with client assets without authorization in different periods between February 1996 and May 1998 causing losses to clients in excess of $6 million. The registration of that dealer's representative has already been revoked as a result.\n\nIn the course of its investigation, the SFC also found that:\n\n\t- there were no adequate supervision of the settlement clerk and proper segregation of duties in respect of settlement matters;\n\n\t- the settlement clerk was able to perform both the dealing and settlement functions in respect of his unauthorized trading through clients' accounts;\n\n\t- there was no proper control over the access to KKM's computer system which allowed unauthorized access to amend transaction records;\n\n\t- there was no proper control over the keeping and issuing of trade documents such as contract notes; and\n\n\t- account executives were allowed to handle settlement matters for their clients without proper authority.\n\n\n\nThe above deficiencies in KKM's internal controls and supervision had facilitated the misconduct of its staff. {X1}, who was the dealing director responsible for managing the day-to-day operation of KKM, had the direct responsibility for the above matters. {X3}, who was the account executive for some of the clients concerned, allowed the settlement clerk to perform the dealing function whilst unregistered. {X2}, who was the immediate supervisor of the settlement clerk, failed to properly supervise his activities.

The four warrants specifically investigated were from a total of 24 listed and traded on the SEHK between October 1998 and March 1999. The investigation found that:\n\n\t- before listing of the four warrants So had via Luen Fat provided nominee placees to another registered dealer (Intermediary 'B') to circumvent the adequate spread of holders requirements of the Listing Rules of the SEHK (Appendix 6A). These nominee placees subscribed and sold back the warrants to this other registered dealer at prices usually slightly higher than their subscription prices. Such placing activities had created the impression that there was a greater interest in the warrants than was actually the case.\n\n\t- after listing of these warrants So had facilitated the two former staff members of Intermediary 'A' to trade warrants for nominee accounts maintained by one of the two staff members and So. The trading involved the selling and repurchase of warrants to and from the nominee accounts and wash sales through Luen Fat and other Hong Kong brokers and resulted in there being few trades in these warrants other than those generated by the two staff members of Intermediary 'A'. So's nominee account earned substantial profits as a result of this service.\n\n\n\n {X}, in his capacity as the chief dealing director responsible for the overall running of Luen Fat's business, bore the ultimate responsibility for having failed to detect and stop So's activities in a timely manner. \n\nThe second case related to Luen Fat's acting as an underwriter for the Initial Public Offer (IPO) of a stock in December 1998. {X} signed the underwriting agreement on behalf of Luen Fat, who failed to detect a client had subscribed shares from both the subscription tranche and the placing tranche of the IPO at the same time. Listing Rules of the SEHK (Practice Note 18) requires an underwriter to take reasonable steps to identify and reject applications in the public subscription tranche from investors who had received shares in the placing tranche, and vice versa. However, Luen Fat had failed to do so which resulted in the client receiving shares from both tranches.\n\nIn view of the above findings the SFC has suspended the registration of So for 18 months and publicly reprimanded Luen Fat and {X}. In deciding on this action the SFC took into account that Luen Fat, {X} and So:\n\n\t- have fully co-operated with and assisted in the SFC's investigation;\n\n\t- accept responsibility for the abovesaid unauthorized and improper trading activities in the warrants; and\n\n\t- have agreed to appoint a more senior compliance officer to enhance their internal control systems.","known_entities":"Luen Fat Securities Company Limited|So Kwan Ming|{X}\t (Note 1)|Kwan Ming So|Luen Fat Securities Company Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announces today that it has reprimanded {X}, a registered dealer representative of Lehin Securities Limited (Lehin), and Lehin, a dealer registered under the Securities Ordinance (SO), upon conclusion of inquiries conducted under section 56 of the SO.\n\n{X} is reprimanded for:\n\n\t- mishandling the operation of two client accounts in breach of provisions of Code of Conduct for Persons Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission; and\n\n\t- failing to observe Lehin's company policy which requires an account executive to have obtained a client's written authorisation before allowing a third party to operate the client's account.\n\n\n\nLehin, on the other hand, is reprimanded for its:\n\n\t- breach of guidelines contained in Management, Supervision and Internal Control Guidelines for Persons Registered with or Licensed by the SFC in that it failed to exercise proper supervision over {X}'s activities;\n\n\t- delay in delivering contract notes to a client within the period prescribed under section 75(1)(a) of the SO; and\n\n\t- failure to deliver contract notes directly to the client.","known_entities":"Lehin Securities Limited|{X}\t (Note 1)|Lehin Securities Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today that it had publicly reprimanded Whole Win Securities Limited (Whole Win), a registered securities dealer, and its dealing director, {X}. \n\nThe reprimand stems from an investigation covering the period from February to March 1998 in which the SFC found that Whole Win had failed to put in place satisfactory internal control procedures:\n\n(a)    to detect and deter short selling by its clients;\n\n(b)    to ensure that persons placing orders for clients were properly authorized to do so; and\n\n(c)    to properly monitor its staff's trading activities.\n\n{X} was the sole dealing director of Whole Win during that period and therefore directly responsible for such failings.

In approving and implementing the November Expiry Strategy the SFC was concerned by an apparent intention to seek to influence the closing price of the Hang Seng Index on the expiry date of the November HSI futures and options and the cash settlement price of these contracts. The SFC is also concerned that the disturbance that the implementation of the Strategy caused in the Hong Kong markets was potentially prejudicial to the interests of members of the investing public. The SFC's action takes into account:\n\n\t- the companies' and senior management's acknowledgement that the SFC has legitimate concerns about the trading activities of the registered entities;\n\n\t- steps taken since the incident to enhance controls to ensure that the registered entities do not knowingly execute any trades which may have the effect of causing such a disturbance and to ensure that its senior management and staff do not engage in conduct in Hong Kong's markets which does not meet Hong Kong's standards of fitness and properness and is not in the best interests of the integrity of Hong Kong markets;\n\n\t- that no client funds were put at risk;\n\n\t- that there was no breach of capital adequacy requirements;\n\n\t- that there was no breach of any applicable regulatory position limits;\n\n\t- the companies' cooperation during the SFC's inquiries;\n\n\t- a voluntary reduction of at least 75% in annual value of its index-arbitrage activities since the incident;\n\n\t- the agreement of the Group not to undertake index arbitrage, issue warrants and to restrict its proprietary trading on the Hong Kong markets to a level agreed with and acceptable to the SFC for a period of 6 months from today.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SFC has also reprimanded {X1}, {X2} and {X3}. None of them was registered with the SFC but the SFC takes the view that they were directors or persons concerned in the management of the relevant corporate entities. In deciding to reprimand them, the SFC has taken into account their cooperation with the SFC and the good regulatory record of the entities within the Group while under {X2}'s management in the four years since the incident.\n\n{X1} was Asia Pacific Chairman of the Banque Indosuez.

He knew of and by implication approved the November Expiry Strategy by recommending the increase in the internal risk limits necessary to the implementation of the November Expiry Strategy. He therefore bears a proportionate level of managerial responsibility to {X1}. He too should have considered more fully than he did the potential effect of the November Expiry Strategy on the integrity of Hong Kong's markets.\n\n{X3} was the manager of the Risk Assessment Team of the Group. As such he was responsible for preparing the memoranda recommending the increase in the internal risk limits necessary to the implementation of the Strategy. Although primarily concerned with the computation of the financial risks involved in the Strategy presented to him by the Trading Desk, he should have been more aware of the potential effects of the November Expiry Strategy on the integrity of Hong Kong's markets.\n\n{X1}, {X2} and {X3} strongly deny that their knowledge and approval of the November Expiry Strategy extended to knowledge and approval of the actual trading methods employed on the 28th November 1996 in the implementation of the Strategy. All have acknowledged, however, the SFC's concerns that the trading methods employed created a market disturbance and as such might be prejudicial to the interests of members of the investing public and should not have occurred. They very much regret the circumstances giving rise to those concerns.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSFC's Findings\n\n\n\nThe disciplinary action resulted from extensive inquiries by the SFC in 1997 into dealings through Carr FE Securities, Carr HK Securities and Carr Futures by the Indosuez W.I. Carr Group (“the Group”) between the 19th and 28th November 1996 on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“SEHK”) and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited (“HKFE”). The activity by these entities was executed by the Group's proprietary trading desk (“the Trading Desk”). This activity involved the Group's actual capital and no customer funds or accounts were implicated. \n\nThe SFC's powers under section 56 of the Securities Ordinance (Cap 333) enable the SFC to sanction conduct which is or may be prejudicial to members of the investing public.\n\nBackground: the trading activity\n\nThe Group held proprietary positions in the cash, futures and options markets during November 1996. Between 21st and 26th November 1996 the Trading Desk gave instructions to futures brokers to close the Group's existing short positions in November Hang Seng Index Futures Contracts (“HSI futures”) and to purchase long contracts in November HSI futures. By the close of business on 27th November, the day before the expiry day of the November HSI futures contracts and Hang Seng Index Futures Options (“HSI Options”), the Trading Desk's book had gone from 4579 short November HSI futures on 18th November to 4180 long November HSI futures. In the same period the Trading Desk bought November long HSI call options traded on HKFE. On 18th November it held 595 such options but at the close of trading on 27th November held 7623 options. In addition they held over the counter November long HSI call options equivalent to 300 HSI options traded on HKFE. These contracts and options were to be cash settled by reference to the final settlement price of the HSI on 28th November 1996. These trades would be profitable if the HSI rose on expiry day. Furthermore, the group has explained that it had bought 458 put options on 26 and 27 November with strike prices of 12,800, 13,000 and 13,200 in order to protect itself against a market fall.\n\nOn 28th November 1996, the expiry date of the November HSI futures contracts and options contracts, the Trading Desk went to an expiry in relation to its position in respect of its long November HSI futures contracts. It placed orders with Carr FE Securities and 7 other independent brokers to purchase parcels of 33 individual securities (“the constituent stocks”) that make up the Hang Seng Index equivalent to about 4800 November HSI futures contracts, worth approximately HKD3.3 billion. Analysis of the securities trading in the constituent stocks on behalf of the Trading Desk showed that :\n\n\t- Initial bids, higher than the previous closing price, were entered resulting in successful opening bids for 8 of the 33 constituent stocks. This is possible because there is no upward limit placed on the first or “opening bid” under SEHK trading rules.\n\n\t- Where the initial bids were unsuccessful, “sweeping” occurred. Sweeping refers to the clearing of the “ask” queues in a particular stock. The bidding rules of SEHK limit price movements. The only way a trader attempting to set the price of a stock could achieve this result is by purchasing all the stocks on offer and then inputting his higher bids i.e. “sweeping”. Once the ask queues had been cleared, bids at a higher level were input. The brokers succeeded in clearing the queues and inputting higher bids in another 6 of the constituent stocks.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers that such trading activities by the Trading Desk were consistent with an intention to push the HSI higher.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index opened 142 points or some 1.04% higher at 13,672 points. The SFC was concerned that this was as a result of these activities. During the first 15 minutes of trading the Hang Seng Index rose a further 72 points to the day's high of 13,744 points before falling back to close the morning session at 13,499 points.\n\nThe Index used to calculate the final settlement price of the expiring HSI futures and HSI options is based on the average of the prices of the 33 constituent stocks on the last trading day of the particular contract. In order to ascertain the average of the prices of the constituent stocks, the actual prices are sampled 47 times during the day at 5-minute intervals. These samples are often referred to as “snapshots”. It was observed in early trading that the price of a number of the constituent stocks moved more than 3% higher than their price in the preceding minute. As a result, and in accordance with a predefined formula used for calculating the final settlement price of the expiring HSI futures and HSI options, the snapshots for the first 10 minutes of trading were automatically disregarded from the calculations.\n\nThe SFC found a particular pattern of trading by the Trading Desk on 28th November 1996 involving aggressive buying activity of the 33 constituent stocks throughout the remainder of the day on behalf of the Group. It is possible for a trader to improve his chance of having his price selected for the “snapshots” by breaking down an order for a substantial quantity of stocks into many small orders of one board lot and then executing the transactions in rapid succession around the time of the “snapshot”. This involves repeated tapping of the key on his keyboard used for accessing the SEHK's computerized trading system and is accordingly known as “tapping”. The SFC found that “tapping” occurred frequently at the current ask price and if the “ask” queue was cleared then the “ask” was tapped at one spread higher or at the next “ask” price.\n\nDuring the morning session of the expiry day, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 13,744 points before selling pressure caused it to lose momentum and then to fall below the previous day's close of 13,530 points before finally closing at 13,310 points. The buying activity and the tapping, particularly during the morning session, affected the samplings for the final settlement price. The final settlement price of the expiring HSI futures and HSI options was calculated at some 178 points higher than the close of the Hang Seng Index on expiry day.\n\nBackground: the approved strategy\n\nThe SFC's inquiry found that {X1} and {X2} had, on two occassions between 21st November 1996 and 27th November 1996, approved in writing the following strategy referred to as “the November Expiry Strategy”. That strategy was itself designed by the Trading Desk and had input from {X3}, as the person responsible for the Group's risk management. Per this strategy, the futures contracts would be allowed to expire and a corresponding quantity of physical stock would be purchased to replace the futures contracts. The strategy only required approval because the Trading Desk would need to increase the Group's trading limits so that it could purchase long November HSI futures contracts. These futures contracts would be allowed to expire and a corresponding quantity of physical stock would be purchased to replace the futures contracts.\n\nThe Trading Desk expected that their trading would contribute to an increase in the price of the 33 constituent stocks and with it the Hang Seng Index. The SFC considers that management, including {X1}, {X2} and {X3}, also expected this. If this happened, the Group would profit from the call options that it already had, and planned to buy. In the event, the implementation of the strategy was unsuccessful. The Trading Desk had bought shares at average prices higher than the final settlement price, and had over-purchased shares. In addition, the Trading Desk bought further November futures on expiry day. This was unauthorised, was not part of the strategy as approved by management, and in fact resulted in the approved trading limits being exceeded. According to management they were not aware of certain of the activities of the Trading Desk in the implementation of the November Expiry Strategy.\n\nThe actions of the Group in this case were of concern to the SFC for two principal reasons. The first was the apparent intention behind the November Expiry Strategy to potentially influence the closing price of the Hang Seng Index on the expiry date of the HSI futures and HSI options and the cash settlement price of these contracts. The second was the disturbance which the implementation of the November Expiry Strategy caused in the market, irrespective of the motives of the Group in formulating this strategy.\n\nThe SFC does not view the trading that occurred as arbitrage trading. Genuine index arbitrage seeks to profit from exploiting the price differentials that arise between the price at which the HSI futures contract is trading at a particular point in time and the price at which the equivalent basket of physical stocks is trading at the same time on the SEHK. The Group had an arbitrage book, an options book and held stock. These could have been used, under appropriate market conditions, to derive a profit from existing price differentials. However the SFC considers that the November Expiry Strategy was not based on the various proprietary books of the Group; rather the books themselves were based on the November Expiry Strategy. The SFC also does not view the purchase of the “call options” as a “directional play”. There is no objection to market transactions based on the view that the securities purchased will rise in value. This happens every day. The position is different where the price is intentionally pushed up by one's own buying and a position is taken, as in this case with the long call options, to profit from that buying. The SFC recognises that the transactions in question involved real purchases with genuine counterparties and actual capital at risk. The Group contended that while they knew that these purchases would probably contribute to an increase in the Hang Seng Index, these purchases did not involve improperly pushing up the price. The SFC, however, considers that this was the object of the November Expiry Strategy, and that insufficient management consideration was given to the potential effect of the Group's actions or to the question as to whether such trading was in fact proper.","known_entities":"Indosuez Carr Futures Limited|Indosuez W.

The Tribunal hearing the appeal found (among other things) that the Appellants' misconduct was too serious for a reprimand to be an adequate penalty and that precedents submitted to the Panel showed that other cases involving revocation also involved some misuse or misappropriation of clients' funds and a lower level of mitigation of misconduct.

The inquiry gave rise to the following grounds of concern:\n\nIn respect of Foreground\n\na) preferential return of clients' securities in relation to one particular client;\n\nb) failure to return securities, cash deposits and proceeds on disposals of securities to clients on 4 occasions;\n\nc) breach of section 81 of the SO by pledging a client's shares without authority;\n\nd) breach of section 84 of the SO in not properly keeping its trust account; and\n\ne) breach of the Financial Resources Rules in not complying with the liquid capital requirement for a prolonged period .\n\nIn respect of Yick\n\nYick, while acting as the sole accredited dealer of Foreground and being wholly responsible for its business:\n\na) had not acted honestly and fairly and in the best interests of clients;\n\nb) failed to properly manage the financial position of Foreground; and\n\nc) failed to effectively and properly manage and supervise Foreground's business, thus resulting in Foreground's misconduct.\n\nIn view of the above, the SFC concluded that both Foreground and Yick had been guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness to be registered as dealers under the SO had been seriously impugned and decided to revoke their registrations as dealers under section 56 of the SO.\n\nBoth Foreground and Yick appealed to the SFAP against the SFC's decision to revoke their respective registrations as dealers. The SFAP hearing the matter dismissed Foreground's appeal on the basis that the company was subsequently wound up by the Court and that the liquidators of Foreground did not wish to continue with the company's appeal (as it was considered not to be beneficial to the creditors nor the winding up of Foreground). In relation to Yick's appeal, the SFAP found (among other things) that Foreground had continuously breached the Financial Resources Rules for a prolonged period and that Yick was responsible for Foreground's state of affairs in his capacity as the sole dealing director. Accordingly, Yick was found not to be a fit and proper person to be registered. The SFC's decision to revoke both Foreground's and Yick's registrations as dealers was thus confirmed by the SFAP.\n\nAn SFC spokesman said: \"The possession of adequate financial resources is a crucial basis to enable sound operation of a registered person's business.

By 5 September 2000, the Chan Family had increased its collective holding to 35.67%. No general offer was made.\n\nMr Chan is registered with the SFC as a securities dealer and a commodity dealer. He acknowledges that he is the principal member and leader of the Chan Family concert group. He actively traded Truly shares during the relevant period placing various purchase orders on his own behalf as well as on behalf of other members of the Chan Family. He provided funding for most of these purchases. Other members of the Chan Family also acquired Truly shares on Mr Chan's recommendation.\n\n\n\nThe Chan Family is considered to be acting in concert for the purposes of the Takeovers Code. As a result the Chan Family has breached Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code in acquiring more than 35% of the shares in Truly without making a general offer. Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code in effect at the relevant time provided that when two or more persons are acting in concert and they collectively hold not less than 35% (this threshold was reduced to 30% on 19 October 2001) a mandatory offer obligation is triggered. The Chan Family's failure to make such an offer amounted to a breach of the Code.\n\nThe Executive considers that the conduct of Mr Chan and the Chan Family has resulted in a serious and blatant breach of a fundamental provision of the Takeovers Code that merits strong disciplinary action. Mr Chan and the Chan Family accept that they have breached the Code and accordingly that shareholders of Truly who should have received a general offer should either receive an equivalent offer or be compensated. However, neither Mr Chan nor any other member of the Chan Family has sufficient resources, and it is unlikely that they would be able to secure sufficient financing for any such offer or compensation payment in the foreseeable future. In the circumstances, Mr Chan and the Chan Family have agreed to disciplinary action being taken against them.\n\nThe Executive wishes to take this opportunity to remind practitioners and parties who wish to take advantage of the securities markets in Hong Kong that they should conduct themselves in matters relating to takeovers and mergers in accordance with the Code. If they do not, they may find that they are subject to sanction.\n\nIn addition, the SFC has concluded that Mr Chan's conduct in this matter has a significant impact on his fitness and properness to remain registered. The SFC has decided that Mr Chan's conduct merits a suspension of Mr Chan's registrations with the SFC for 30 months. In forming this view the SFC has taken into account Mr Chan's primary role in the breach and that he was a principal member and the leader of the concert group. Mr Chan's conduct clearly fell far short of that expected of an experienced registrant and licensee. The SFC has also taken into account the fact that this is not the first time that Mr Chan's fitness and properness to remain registered have been called into question. On 1 November 1997 Mr Chan's registrations with the SFC were suspended for 30 months. One of the factors taken into account by the SFC at the time was that Mr Chan had failed to ensure effective controls and procedures were in place resulting in trading malpractices. The SFC considers Mr Chan's previous suspensions to be an aggravating feature.\n\nAn SFC spokesman said: \"Any registrant who fails to abide by the codes or guidelines issued by the SFC or other applicable laws would cast serious doubts on whether he is fit and proper to remain registered. The SFC considers such matters important in maintaining a fair and orderly market and in protecting investors' interests, and will not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against the registrant accordingly.\"","known_entities":"Chan Kin Sun|Chan Lai Lai, Karen|Chan Lai Lan|Cheng Kwan Ying, Jennifer|Cheng Mei Ying, Michelle|Yu Wing Keung|Za Ah Fong|Lai Lai Chan|Karen Chan|Karen Lai Lai Chan|Kin Sun Chan|Michelle Cheng|Mei Ying Cheng|Michelle Mei Ying Cheng|Lai Lan Chan|Wing Keung Yu|Jennifer Kwan Ying Cheng|Jennifer Cheng|Kwan Ying Cheng|Ah Fong Za"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announces today that it has suspended the registration of Mr Tam Po Kwok (Tam), a registered securities dealer's representative, for a period of 6 months pursuant to section 56(2) of the Securities Ordinance, for misconduct and because his fitness and properness has been impugned.\n\nThe suspension followed an investigation into the activities of Tam during 2000 in respect of his handling of a client account when he was a dealer's representative of Sincere Securities Limited. Tam had, during the SFC's investigation, produced a signed written authorization that authorized him to operate a client's account. The SFC found that the client had not granted any authorization to Tam despite the existence of the purported authorization. The client was led to believe by Tam that she had signed a receipt when in fact it was an authorization. Tam failed to disclose the true nature of the document to his client despite his duty as a fiduciary and agent.\n\nTam's actions in this matter were unethical and prejudicial to his client's interest and reflected on his honesty and integrity. The SFC considered that a period of suspension had to be imposed in those circumstances.\n\nThe SFC issued its decision to suspend Tam's registration in December 2001. However, Tam appealed against the decision. On 3 June 2002, shortly before the appeal hearing scheduled for 5 June 2002, Tam was allowed to formally withdraw his appeal by the Securities and Futures Appeals Panel. His suspension therefore took effect on 3 June 2002.\n\nAn SFC spokesman said registered persons owed a duty to clients to act in their best interests. That duty includes ensuring at all times that documentation provided to clients is fully explained to them and information given is accurate and not misleading.

The answers she gave at the interview were materially different from those given by her to a court in a later criminal prosecution. In that court case, Mr Yeung Yik Cheung was convicted on 18 December 2001 for intentionally creating a false and misleading appearance of active trading in the shares of Good Fellow Group Ltd.\n\nThe SFC found that Chiang had recklessly provided it with misleading information which had the potential to jeopardise not only the SFC investigation but also the court hearing.\n\nThe SFC also found that during the period 6 August 1999 to 10 December 1999 Chiang had allowed an account of one of her clients to be operated by third parties. Her actions were contrary to the internal policy of her then employer, Wing On Cheong Securities Company Limited and exposed herself, the client and Wing On Cheong to possible financial risk if any of the trades were dishonoured.\n\nAn SFC spokesman said: \"The SFC expects registered persons to cooperate with, and provide assistance to the SFC at all times.

The inquiry revealed that Wu had:\n\n\t- failed to safeguard the interests of a client in that prior to becoming a registered person in 1997, he traded securities for the client through his personal account and/or his friend's account with a broker. The client's assets were subsequently retained by the broker to offset the debit balance in his or his friend's account;\n\n\t- failed to protect the client's interests after he became a registered person in 1998 in that he failed to open an account in the client's name to deposit the client's assets; and\n\n\t- failed to settle promptly his debt owed to the client.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concluded that Wu's conduct fell below the standards of a registered dealer's representative and his fitness and properness to remain registered has been seriously called into question.

Such orders affected the closing price of the stock and were potentially improper or illegal. The SFC also found that Poon's supervisor had warned Poon to be cautious in handling client orders of this type. Despite the warning, Poon continued to accept such orders from the client, resulting in a much higher closing share price of the stock than it should have been on 23 October 2000.\n\nThe SFC further found that Poon had counselled his clients to circumvent the Rules of the Exchange (ROE) in force at the time that governed the allowable order prices. During the above period, Poon's clients placed orders to Poon at prices that were not allowed by the ROE. To circumvent the ROE, Poon advised his clients to put up a series of small quantity orders for the stock and cancelled them shortly afterwards with a view to moving the share prices up or down so that they could put up their orders at desired price levels.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the SFC concluded that Poon has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness had been called into question, and that his registrations should be suspended for one month.\n\n\n\nAlan Linning, SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Placing small quantity orders at prices that deviate from the prevailing price near market close is a classic way to manipulate share closing prices.

Young was also verbally authorized by the client's husband to conduct discretionary trades in that client's account, but Young failed to put this authorization in writing or to tell Magnum about it.

It has also publicly reprimanded {X}, a dealer's representative of Polaris.\n\nThe action stemmed from a number of complaints received by the SFC about the activities of staff of Polaris, including some of its senior staff, between late 2000 and early 2002. The complaints made and subsequent investigations revealed:\n\n\t- a lack of proper internal controls and procedures at Polaris for account opening, settlement, securities dealing and credit control;\n\n\t- a lack of a proper management system; and\n\n\t- ineffective monitoring of the activities of Polaris's staff.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Tsoi, as a dealing director of Polaris responsible for its day-to-day operations, bore direct responsibility for the failings identified above in the internal controls and procedures at Polaris and for failing to properly supervise staff under his direct control. In addition, Tsoi had also facilitated the opening and operation of a nominee account for one of his clients during the period from early 2001 to March 2002. The SFC views Tsoi's conduct in this matter very seriously and considers that an immediate suspension of his registration is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nThe SFC also found that from March 2000 to June 2001 {X} had allowed a third party to operate 21 client accounts without proper written authorization being obtained. Furthermore, the SFC established that he had knowingly dealt in securities for an employee of another registered person without having first sought the written consent of that other registered person, contrary to the Code of Conduct for Persons Registered with the SFC.\n\nIn deciding on the appropriate penalties in this case, the SFC has taken into account that:\n\n\t- Polaris appointed a firm of accountants to review its operations and has implemented the recommendations made by the accountants;\n\n\t- Polaris agreed to conduct a further follow up review by the accountants in order to ensure continued implementation of all the recommendations made by the accountants;\n\n\t- Polaris has strengthened its supervisory capabilities and compliance functions by appointing additional directors and a new compliance officer; and\n\n\t- Polaris, Tsoi and {X} co-operated fully with the SFC during its inquiry.\n\n\n\nAlan Linning, Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"A broker firm must establish and maintain an effective management and organizational structure which ensures that its operations are conducted in a sound, efficient and effective manner with due regard to the interests of its clients and to the integrity of the market.

Further, she also deceived her clients to buy into apparently very favourable, but fictitious, investment schemes allegedly involving blue chip shares.\n\nBeing a settlement clerk as well as an account executive, Chan covered up her activities with ease by forging account statements.

Chan did not use the payments made by the clients to purchase the securities, but instead converted them to her own use; and\n\n\t- Chan was responsible for both settlement and dealing functions, and was able to change the clients' correspondence address on Hou Tak's records; as a result, the clients did not receive the official trading statements issued by Hou Tak.\n\n\n\nChan's conduct involved a fundamental breach of trust, and made her completely unfit to remain registered.

They were ordered to pay the Securities and Futures Commission's investigation costs of $39,128.\n\nDuring sentencing, the Magistrate commented that these were serious offences which the defendants had carried out intentionally in the hope of gaining substantial profits without regard to how it would affect the financial position of the investing public. He also refused the application for suspended sentence because it would not properly reflect the seriousness of the crime or the need to sentence as a deterrent.\n\nThe SFC welcomes the decision of the Magistrate and is encouraged by his comments on the seriousness of the offences. An SFC spokesman said: \"We agree that the penalties imposed should serve as a strong warning to deter those intending to manipulate shares listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.\"\n\nThe SFC found that on 15 November 1999, Choy had placed matching buy and sell orders for Parkview shares within a short duration of time through two different brokers. As a result of these transactions, also known as \"wash sales\", Choy effected a purchase and sale of Parkview shares which involved no change in the beneficial ownership of those shares, but which served to create a false appearance of active trading in the stock which was likely to mislead the investing public.\n\nOn the same day, Yuen, accompanied by Choy, opened an account with one of the brokers used by Choy.\n\nDuring the three trading days between 19 and 23 November 1999, Choy and Yuen traded with each other in Parkview shares, and their trading accounted for a substantial portion of the total turnover of Parkview shares. The transactions were also conducted within five minutes before the market close and at prices higher than the last transaction price and the previous closing price, which had the effect of artificially inflating the price of the shares and created a false or misleading appearance of active trading.\n\nThe defendants were convicted under sections 135(1)(a) and 139 of the Securities Ordinance.

The Takeovers Panel, amongst other things, was particularly critical of Chan's conduct having regard to his status as a registered person and the dealing director and managing director of a brokerage firm. Chan was publicly censured by the Takeovers Panel for his failure to comply with General Principle 10 of the Code2.\n\nThe findings and comments against Chan made by the Takeovers Panel are very serious. They point to Chan who:\n\nacted in concert with another person in complete disregard of the Code;\n\nwould, together with that person, have breached Rule 26.1 of the Code but for the breach one day earlier by that person acting in concert with a third party (of which Chan was unaware);\n\nultimately caused loss to Kong Tai's shareholders as a result of his actions;\n\nfailed to act in accordance with the standards of conduct that might reasonably be expected of a registered and licensed person;\n\ngave less than frank disclosure to the Takeovers Panel of the agreements or understandings that existed between himself and that person; and\n\nknowingly and deliberately failed to comply with General Principle 10 of the Code. As a result of the decision of the Takeovers Panel, the SFC initiated its own inquiries into the conduct of Chan under relevant Ordinances. At the end of its inquiries, the SFC concluded that the seriousness of those findings had called into question Chan's fitness and properness to remain registered. As an experienced registrant and licensee, Chan's conduct during the course of the Kong Tai matter clearly fell far short of that expected of him. Accordingly, the SFC decided to suspend Chan's registrations and licence for a period of two years.\n\nChan was dissatisfied with and appealed the SFC's decision. In a decision released on 22 March 2002, the Appeals Panel dismissed Chan's appeal and upheld the SFC's decision.\n\nAn SFC spokesman said: \"Any registrant who knowingly or negligently assists other persons in breaching the codes or guidelines issued by the SFC or other applicable laws would cast serious doubts on whether he is fit and proper to remain registered. The SFC considers such matters important in maintaining a fair and orderly market and in protecting investors' interests, and will not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against the registrant accordingly.\"\n\n\n\nNote to editors:\n\n1.

Ltd. (Yizheng) on 22 and 23 February 2001 respectively. The SFC found that on several occasions on each of the two days, Wu firstly placed a few small buy orders in Yizheng shares at or near the prevailing market price. Thereafter, on 22 February 2001 Wu placed 21 buy orders and 28 sell orders, each order being for 1 million Yizheng shares at prices between 1 to 5 spread below or above the then prevailing market price.

Mr. Wong was formerly the chief executive and a director of Asia Financial (Assets Management) Limited (\"AFAM\") and is registered as an investment adviser director and commodity dealer with the SFC. The Panel also publicly censures Mr. Wong in relation to his conduct and intends to report Mr. Wong's conduct to the SFC for consideration of his conduct. \n\nThe Panel also publicly censures AFAM. AFAM is an investment management company registered with the SFC as an investment adviser and commodity trading adviser. The Panel intends to report AFAM to the SFC and any other appropriate regulatory authorities in respect of its conduct and management.\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe background to this matter is that from June 2000 to March 2001 AFAM acquired more than 35% of shares in Tack Hsin for seven investment companies in breach of Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code. AFAM provided discretionary management services for the seven investment companies. Mr. Wong was the Chief Executive and the director of AFAM who undertook the day-to-day management of AFAM and made the investment decisions regarding the acquisitions of Tack Hsin shares.\n\nThe Panel found that AFAM and the investment companies were acting in concert. As a result the Panel found that AFAM had breached Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code in acquiring more than 35% of the shares in Tack Hsin for those investment companies without making a general offer. Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code that was effective at the time provided that when two or more persons are acting in concert and they collectively hold not less than 35% (this threshold was reduced to 30% on 19 October 2001) a mandatory offer obligation is triggered. Failure to make such an offer amounted to a breach of the Code.\n\n\n\nSanctions against Mr. Wong\n\nIn reaching its decision to sanction Mr. Wong, the Panel paid particular regard to Mr. Wong's overall role in causing AFAM to breach Rule 26.1 of the Code and to the standards of behaviour and integrity that might reasonably be expected of a registered person engaged in the management of funds on behalf of third parties. As the Chief Executive and one of two directors of AFAM registered with the SFC, Mr. Wong had a clear and evident responsibility for the proper management of AFAM both as regards matters of commercial integrity and regulatory compliance. Viewed as a whole the Panel considers that the actions of Mr. Wong were wholly inconsistent with the standards expected of the chief executive of a registered investment management company and a registered person. Mr. Wong's actions directly led to the breach of Rule 26.1 of the Code by AFAM. The Panel concluded that a severe sanction was merited having regard to the facts of and the reasoning set out in its decision.\n\nSanctions against AFAM\n\nAs regards its decision to sanction AFAM, the Panel found that AFAM itself had made no efforts to comply with the mandatory offer provisions of Rule 26.1 of the Code but retained (as at the dates of the Panel meetings) the benefit of the fees arising out of the transactions that led to that breach.\n\nThe Panel also had regard to the circumstances which allowed Mr. Wong to operate as he did and to the lack of remedial measures that AFAM itself took in response to the discovery of the breach. The Panel believes that, AFAM contributed in no small measure to its own predicament. Its management and conduct fell far short of that which the Panel would expect of a registered investment management company and member of a substantial financial services group.\n\nThe Panel considers these to be serious matters that fully merit the sanctions imposed.\n\nA copy of the Panel Decision and Order is attached.\n\nA copy of the Panel Decision and the relevant Takeovers Code provisions can be found in the Takeovers and Mergers Panel Decisions section of the SFC Website at http://hksfc.org.hk.","known_entities":"Wong Man Shek, Anthony|Man Shek Wong|Anthony Man Shek Wong|Anthony Wong"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today that it had revoked the registration of Mr Ngai Tsz Keung (Ngai), an investment representative under the Securities Ordinance (SO).\n\nThe revocation followed an inquiry conducted under section 56 of the SO which revealed that Ngai had made false representation to the SFC in respect of his educational qualification for the purpose of obtaining registration as an investment representative.

The affected clients, totalling about 300, had indicated that they would not exercise their rights or could not be contacted before the rights issue lapsed. Cargary exercised the rights of these clients by paying the consideration to acquire the shares, sold them subsequently, and initially retained the profits amounting to about $340,000 in its own account.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that the directors and staff of Cargary responsible for the matter had all mistakenly thought that exercising its clients' rights in this manner was acceptable until Cargary's auditors and legal advisers pointed out that it was improper.\n\n\n\nBy exercising clients' rights without their consent, Cargary was in breach of the trust the clients had placed in it and placed itself in a position where it had conflicts of interests with its clients. In addition, as the rights belonged to Cargary's clients, profits generated from the exercising of the rights should, from the outset, have been held on trust for clients but were not. By retaining the profits in its own account, Cargary was in breach of section 84 of the Securities Ordinance which requires brokers to put all amounts which are received for or on account of any person into a trust account kept in a licensed bank. Cargary subsequently transferred this sum to a trust account where it is held for the benefit of the clients concerned and the profits will be distributed to these clients.\n\n\n\nThe SFC also found that, at the relevant time, Cargary did not apply adequate resources to ensure the compliance of its business activities with the relevant law and its internal control procedures in respect of proprietary trading were inadequate.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Cargary has been called into question and decides to reprimand it. In deciding on this course, the SFC has taken into account that:\n\n\n\nCargary took the initiative to report the matter to the SFC;\n\nall the profits have already been put in a trust account and will be distributed to the clients concerned; and\n\nit has significantly improved its internal control procedures.\n\n\n\nThe SFC acknowledges that Cargary has since undergone a substantial reform and has significantly improved relevant procedures. It has appointed more experienced persons as its directors to strengthen its management. It has also appointed a new compliance officer, established a new Legal and Compliance Department, revamped its operations manual, and conducted regular compliance training for its staff to ensure continual compliance with all regulatory requirements. In connection with its restructuring, since September 2002, Cargary has been renamed as CITIC Capital Securities Limited.\n\n\n\nWong Cheuk Ming, Cargary's former managing director, bears primary responsibility for Cargary's failures and his licence has been suspended for four months. Hung Chi Ming, Cargary’s responsible officer, bears partial responsibility for Cargary’s failures. Hung's licence has also been suspended for two months.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Under no circumstances should a licensee exercise clients' rights without their express consent and put itself in a position where it has conflicts of interest with its clients.

However, the SFC found that there might not be sufficient genuine market for the warrants because all the warrants subscribed for by the placees introduced by Leung were, in almost all of the cases, sold back to the issuer through the placing agent by Leung on the next business day after the warrants were issued. The SFC found that as a result of Leung’s action in providing these placees for the placements, the market and the investing public might have been led to believe that each and every one of the 32 issues of warrants launched was a success because there appeared to be an adequate level of demand for and activity in those warrants at the time of listing when in fact there might not have been.  \n\nLeung acknowledged that he was negligent in not having realised that, by providing the placees to subscribe for the warrants and by selling back the warrants in the way he did could deceive the market as stated in the public announcement of the SFC (note 1).  Leung also acknowledged that he now realised that the placing arrangement that he had with the placing agent might mislead the market and the investing public into believing that there was a higher demand for, and activities in, those warrants when this was not the case.  \n\nThe SFC also found that Leung breached paragraph 7 of the Placing Guidelines which prohibited, among other things, staff of placing agents from allocating any warrants to their close relatives on whose behalf they had a discretion to conduct transactions.  The SFC found that Leung had allocated the warrants to his wife’s and sister’s accounts for which he was given a discretion to conduct transactions, and as such he breached paragraph 7.   \n\nAs a result of the above findings, Leung has agreed to accept a public reprimand for his conduct and to voluntarily surrender his registrations as a dealing director/dealer under the Securities Ordinance (SO) and the Commodities Trading Ordinance (CTO) and has undertaken not to re-apply for registration as a dealing director/dealer/responsible director or responsible officer under the SO, CTO, Leveraged Foreign Exchange Trading Ordinance or any successor legislation for a period of eight months.  In reaching this agreement the SFC had taken into account the co-operation of Leung and that HKEx changed the listing requirements for derivative warrants on 10 December 2001 and issuers are no longer required to place an issue of warrants to a minimum number of independent placees. \n\nAlan Linning, SFC Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Even though they have been repealed, the minimum independent public float requirements for the listing of warrants were important when they were in force.  Artificial schemes which created the appearance that there was a minimum number of independent people holding the warrants at the time of listing, when this was not the case, could have misled investors as to the real state of movement for the warrants and the viability of the post-listing market and were improper.  We will take disciplinary action against those involved in such schemes.” \n\nNote :\n\n1. The SFC’s 7 June 2001 press release stated the SFC’s concern that the pre-arrangement of issuers for brokers, placing agents and investors to take up the warrants on the understanding that the issuers would repurchase the warrants was unacceptable because this might deceive the market by giving a false and misleading appearance of the market for the warrants.  The SFC warned it might take disciplinary action against any person involved in such activities. \n\n2) The SFC announces today that it has suspended the registration of Mr Ho Chu Ming George. \n\nThe SFC found that, during the period between October 1998 and May 1999, Ho provided names of some 30 of his and his company’s clients, apparently without the relevant clients’ prior knowledge and authority, to the placing agent as placees in 33 warrants issues which were used by the issuer of those warrants to ostensibly satisfy the Placing Guidelines of the Stock Exchange’s Main Board Listing Rules in force at the time. The relevant Placing Guidelines required that for a warrant to be listed, it had to have an adequate spread of holders, specified as, at least 100 holders among other things.  \n\nThe SFC found that Ho knew that the placees he provided were needed for this adequate spread rule. However, the SFC found that there was no genuine market for the warrants because all the warrants subscribed for by the placees introduced by Ho were, almost in all the cases, sold back to the issuer through the placing agent on the next business day after the warrants were issued and the decision to subscribe the warrants was discretionarily made by Ho without the placees’ prior knowledge.  The SFC found that as a result of Ho’s action in providing sham placees for the placements, the market and the investing public was led to believe that each and every one of the 33 issues of warrants launched was a success because there appeared to be an adequate level of demand for and activity in those warrants at the time of listing when in fact there was not. \n\nHo admitted that, by providing the placees to subscribe for the warrants and by selling back the warrants in the way he did, was improper.  Ho also apologized for, through the placing arrangement that he had with the placing agent, having misled the market and the investing public into believing that there was a higher demand for and activities in those warrants when this was not the case.  \n\nThe SFC also found that Ho breached paragraph 7 of the Placing Guidelines which prohibited, among other things, staff of placing agents from allocating any warrants to their close relatives on whose behalf they had a discretion to conduct transactions.   Ho admitted that he had allocated the warrants to the accounts of his close relatives for which he was given discretion to conduct transactions, and as such he breached paragraph 7.   \n\nAs a result of the above findings, Ho has agreed to accept, for his conduct, a suspension of his registration as a dealer representative under the Securities Ordinance and as a commodity dealer’s representative under the Commodity Trading Ordinance for a period of three months, effective from 18 September 2002. In reaching this agreement the SFC had taken into account that Ho was co-operative and remorseful during the inquiry and that HKEx changed the listing requirements for derivative warrants on 10 December 2001 and issuers are no longer required to place an issue of warrants to a minimum number of independent placees.  \n\nAlan Linning, SFC Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Even though they have been repealed, the minimum independent public float requirements for the listing of warrants were important when they were in force.  Artificial schemes which created the appearance that there was a minimum number of independent people holding the warrants at the time of listing, when this was not the case, could have misled investors as to the real state of movement for the warrants and the viability of the post-listing market and were improper.  We will take disciplinary action against those involved in such schemes.” \n\n3)  The SFC announces today that it has suspended the registration of Mr Heng Hian Mok. \n\nThe SFC found that, during the period between October 1998 and May 1999, Heng provided names of some 30 of his and his company’s clients, in all but the first few instances, without the relevant clients’ prior knowledge and authority, to the placing agent as placees in 33 warrants issues which were used by the issuer of those warrants to ostensibly satisfy the Placing Guidelines of the Stock Exchange’s Main Board Listing Rules in force at the time. The Guidelines, at that time, required that, for a warrant to be listed, it had to have an adequate spread of holders, specified as, at least 100 holders among other things.  \n\nThe SFC found that Heng knew that the placees he provided were needed for this adequate spread rule. However, the SFC found that there was no genuine market for the warrants because all the warrants subscribed for by the placees introduced by Heng were, almost in all the cases, sold back to the issuer through the placing agent on the next business day after the warrants were issued and the decision to subscribe the warrants was discretionarily made by Heng without the placees’ prior knowledge.  The SFC found that as a result of Heng’s action in providing sham placees for the placements, the market and the investing public was led to believe that each and every one of the 33 issues of warrants launched was a success because there appeared to be an adequate level of demand for and activity in those warrants at the time of listing when in fact there was not. \n\nHeng acknowledged that, by providing the placees to subscribe for the warrants and by selling back the warrants in the way he did, was improper.  Heng also acknowledged that, through the placing arrangement that he had with the placing agent, had misled the market and the investing public into believing that there was a higher demand for and activities in those warrants when this was not the case.  \n\nThe SFC also found that Heng breached paragraph 7 of the Placing Guidelines which prohibited, among other things, staff of placing agents from allocating any warrants to their close relatives on whose behalf they had a discretion to conduct transactions.   Heng had allocated the warrants to the accounts of his wife and relatives which he had in effect managed discretionarily, and he therefore breached paragraph 7.   \n\nOn 26 November 2002, Heng pleaded guilty before Ms Polly Lo at Western Magistracy to 24 summonses of short selling securities in contravention of Section 80 of the Securities Ordinance. He was fined $48,000 and ordered to pay investigation costs of $8,335 to the SFC. \n\nAs a result of the above findings and his conviction, Heng has accepted, for his conduct, a suspension of his registration as a dealing director and as a financier’s representative under the Securities Ordinance for a total period of four months, being three months for the providing sham placees for warrants issues and one month for the short selling conviction. The suspension takes effect from 1 September 2002. \n\nIn reaching this agreement the SFC had taken into account that Heng was co-operative during the inquiry and that HKEx changed the listing requirements for derivative warrants on 10 December 2001 and issuers are no longer required to place an issue of warrants to a minimum number of independent placees.  \n\nAlan Linning, SFC Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Even though they have been repealed, the minimum independent public float requirements for the listing of warrants were important when they were in force.  Artificial schemes which created the appearance that there was a minimum number of independent people holding the warrants at the time of listing, when this was not the case, could have misled investors as to the real state of movement for the warrants and the viability of the post-listing market and were improper.  We will take disciplinary action against those involved in such schemes.” \n\nEnds","known_entities":"Hian Mok Heng|Ho Chu Ming George|Leung Wing Fai|George Ho|George Chu Ming Ho|Chu Ming Ho|Wing Fai Leung|Mok Heng Hian"},{"article_body":"The SFC has successfully prosecuted Mr Wong On Ching for manipulating the share price of Victory Group Limited.\n\n\n\nWong pleaded guilty before Mr Anthony Yuen, a Magistrate at Western Magistracy to one summons for intentionally creating a false market in respect of the Victory shares in September 2000.

The Takeovers and Mergers Executive has imposed an order denying Lai direct or indirect access to the securities markets (a Cold Shoulder Order) for a period of six months commencing on Thursday 30 January 2003.\n\n2. The Executive also publicly censures Lai and Raffles in relation to their conduct in this matter. \n\nThe background to this matter is that on 20 January 2003 Raffles, a company of which Lai is the sole owner and sole director, increased its shareholding in FT Holdings International Limited from 34.99% to 36.05%. No general offer has been made in breach of Rule 26.1 of the Takeovers Code. This is because the old 35% threshold for triggering a mandatory general offer obligation applies to Raffles under the Takeovers Code as it had held between 30% and 35% interest in FT Holdings since immediately before the reduction of the trigger to 30% on 19 October 2001.\n\nThe Executive considers that the conduct of Lai and Raffles has resulted in a clear breach of a fundamental provision of the Takeovers Code that merits strong disciplinary action. Lai and Raffles accept that they have breached the Code and accordingly that shareholders of FT Holdings should have received a general offer.\n\nHowever, Lai has indicated that he is not in a position to finance any such offer. In the circumstances, Lai and Raffles have agreed to disciplinary action being taken against them. Lai apologises for the breach in question and has undertaken to use his best endeavours to reduce Raffles’ shareholding to below 35% as soon as possible after the Cold Shoulder Order has expired by disposing of its shares to independent third parties. In the meantime, Lai has also agreed not to exercise the voting rights attached to the 3,650,000 additional shares acquired by Raffles on 20 January 2003.\n\nThe Executive wishes to take this opportunity to remind practitioners and parties who wish to take advantage of the securities markets in Hong Kong that they should conduct themselves in matters relating to takeovers and mergers in accordance with the Code. If they do not, they may find that they are subject to sanction.

By this transaction, Get Nice breached Rule 539 of the Rules of the Exchange, which prohibits a member of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited from dealing in suspended securities. \n\nThe SFC further found that Get Nice had failed to ensure that its margin finance business conducted via Get Nice Finance Company Limited (GNF) was conducted properly. The SFC found that Get Nice did not have proper credit controls in relation to the transactions of the client involved in the above transaction. Despite little knowledge of the client’s background and financial status, and a large debit balance in the client account in GNF, Get Nice allowed large purchase transactions in the account.\n\nLastly, the SFC found that there was no proper audit trail when the client withdrew the proceeds of the subsequent sale of the above shares from the client account between January and March 2000. The SFC found that of the three cheque withdrawals recorded at GNF as being payable to the client, one cheque had been altered to cash, another had been altered to be payable to a third party, and the remaining cheque had been paid to a company controlled by {X1}. There was no clear audit trail as to the change of the original cheque payee to cash or to a third party.  There were also inadequate controls in place to ensure that the relevant cheques were collected by authorised parties or delivered to the client.\n\nThese inadequacies posed risks to the client and Get Nice should the client dispute the validity of the transactions in question. That one of the above cheques (for an amount of $12 million) was deposited to a company controlled by {X1} illustrates the dangers securities brokerage firms expose themselves to if clients dispute the disposal of cheques when cheques handling audit trails are incomplete.(Note 1)\n\nThe incidents detailed above indicated that Get Nice did not have proper procedures or guidelines to:\n\n prevent dealing in suspended stocks ; and\n\n ensure that its margin finance business was being conducted properly by ensuring that proper audit trails for the issuance, alteration and delivery of cheques were instituted and followed.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the above findings the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Get Nice as a licensed corporation has been called into question and decides to reprimand it. \n\nGet Nice’s management\n\n{X1}, who knew the shares of the stock were suspended at the time, directed staff of Get Nice to arrange for the off-market transfer of five million Cheung Wah shares on 17 January 2000. Despite having over 10 years’ experience in the securities industry and his senior position in Get Nice, {X1} failed to realise that dealing in suspended shares was prohibited and caused Get Nice to breach Rule 539 of the Rules of the Exchange. {X1}’s act posed regulatory risk to himself, Get Nice and the market.\n\n{X1} also participated in the handling of the client’s account including approving margin finance to the client and settlement-related matters.  The SFC found that he was also responsible for Get Nice’s failures in lacking proper credit controls and a proper audit trail of fund withdrawals. Therefore, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of {X1} has been called into question and decides to reprimand him. {X1} is not licensed by the SFC, and a reprimand is the maximum penalty that the SFC can impose on him. Had {X1} been licensed by the SFC, the SFC would have imposed a more severe penalty on him.\n\n{X2} was a director at Get Nice responsible for supervision of its regulated business at the time (Note 2).

During such suspension, there is a high likelihood that material information relating to the shares will be issued to the market in the form of an announcement before the suspension ends. Therefore, dealing in suspended securities poses a serious regulatory risk to a broker firm and market integrity, for example, by possibly facilitating insider dealing. A broker firm should prohibit it except for circumstances specified in the Rules of the Exchange.”\n\n“In addition, broker firms should keep a proper audit trail of fund withdrawals to protect their clients and the integrity of their dealing practices. Broker firms should also adhere to Know Your Client Rule and establish proper credit controls based on clients’ background and financial status.

Sharegain dismissed the dealer's representative in January 2001 for misconduct but did not report the incident and the dismissal to the SFC until August 2001.\n\nThe SFC found that Sharegain did not have adequate internal controls, in particular adequate segregation of duties and supervisory controls, which facilitated the dealer's representative's misconduct.

While he had compensated the clients, he failed to recognise that he had a duty to follow up on other issues arising from the misappropriation and to make reasonable enquiry to ensure that {X1} had properly discharged his responsibilities.\n\nAs a result, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Sharegain, {X1} and {X2} has been called into question and decided to publicly reprimand them after taking into account Sharegain's undertaking to improve its internal control system.

Yardley Securities only verbally informed the clients of the profit and loss, and settled the subscription and grey market trades with them in cash. Leung, as a director of Yardley Securities, made the decision to destroy all of the firm’s internal records concerning these trades. These actions deprived Yardley Securities’ clients of one of their most basic rights, to have a record of their investments. They also hindered the SFC’s investigation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Yardley Securities and Leung knowingly allowed Yardley Asset Management Limited (which had the same ultimate beneficial owner as Yardley Securities) to buy derivative warrants from Yardley Securities’ clients, without disclosing the fact that the buyer was connected, hence creating a conflict of interests.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s Code of Conduct in force at the time required Yardley Securities, in such circumstances, either not to deal in those transactions or to take all reasonable steps to ensure fair treatment of clients. Yardley Securities did the opposite, allowing Yardley Asset Management to deal in the transactions and destroying all relevant records.\n\n\n\nYardley Securities’ actions made it impossible to reconstruct events in relation to clients’ warrants subscription and grey market trades or to verify whether Yardley Securities had treated clients unfairly when Yardley Asset Management bought their warrants in the grey market. The situation exposed clients to tremendous risks. Moreover, the SFC has not been able to establish if Yardley Securities’ clients have suffered any loss as a result.\n\n\n\nThe failings of Yardley Securities and Leung call into question their fitness and properness. The SFC decides to severely reprimand Yardley Securities. Although Leung was not licensed for dealing in or advising on securities, he could make management decisions in Yardley Securities as a director.

Destroying documents required to be kept by law or SFC regulations is very serious misconduct that we won’t tolerate. Yardley Securities did both and so kept no audit trail of their grey market trading in warrants on behalf of clients. This put clients at risk, especially as Yardley Asset Management bought warrants from clients of Yardley Securities, a possible and suspicious conflict of interests that was never revealed to Yardley Securities’ clients. Owing to the lack of an audit trail, we have been unable to establish whether Yardley Securities’ clients have suffered any loss. Yardley Securities, with its failings, deserved to be reprimanded.

Both Lau and Chan are responsible officers of LSH (Note 1). \n\nThe actions stem from a routine inspection of LSH by the SFC in November 2001. The inspection found that a former dealing director of LSH, Mr Heng Hian Mok, had been suspected of engaging in illegal short selling of securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Heng later pleaded guilty to 24 summonses under section 80 of the Securities Ordinance.

The SFC found that they had failed to exercise due care and diligence in discharging their duties to the standards expected of them as a dealing director. Their failures in relation to LSH’s operations had called into question their abilities to carry out their functions as a dealing director in a fair and efficient manner.\n\nAs a result, the SFC has decided to discipline LSH, Lau and Chan.

The suspension took effect immediately after the decision of the SFAT, which last week issued its reasons.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe SFC conducted an inquiry into the conduct of Victory following its reporting of misappropriation of clients assets by two former dealer’s representatives from June 1998 to June 2001 (Note 1).\n\n\n\nIn July 2001, an independent accounting firm was commissioned by Victory at the SFC’s request to conduct a comprehensive review of Victory’s internal control system. A number of major deficiencies were identified during the review (Note 2).\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Wong, who was responsible for Victory’s day-to-day operations, bore direct responsibility for the failings identified by the independent accounting firm. In particular:\n\n\n\n\t- he failed in his duty to put in place adequate and effective internal control procedures to protect Victory and its clients from financial loss; and\n\n\t- he acted improperly by arranging private loans to certain client accounts of the two former dealer’s representatives, which directly or indirectly facilitated their misconduct.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considered that, had Wong contacted those clients requesting them to settle the long outstanding sums in their accounts rather than arranging private loans to them, he would have discovered the misappropriation by the two former dealer’s representatives several months earlier and would have therefore minimised the losses to Victory and its clients.\n\n\n\nIn light of these findings, the SFC concluded that the fitness and properness of Wong as a licensed person had been called into question. In July this year, the SFC therefore decided to suspend the licence of Wong for six weeks. When making that decision, the SFC took into account that:\n\n\n\nWong reported the matter to the SFC;\n\nWong co-operated fully with the SFC during the investigation; and\n\nVictory compensated the clients’ losses promptly.\n\n\n\nWong applied to the SFAT for a review of the SFC’s decision.\n\n\n\nReview by the Tribunal\n\n\n\nThe SFAT review hearing took place on 25 September 2003 (Note 3). The SFAT considered that it was difficult to discern any merit in Wong’s application for review, and dismissed the application at the conclusion of the hearing. As a result, the SFAT affirmed the SFC’s decision to suspend Wong for six weeks.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT’s reasons for its decision were issued on 16 October 2003 (Note 4). In those reasons, the SFAT made important comments about how it would handle appeals/reviews:\n\n\n\n\"An appellate/reviewing tribunal is in principle reluctant to interfere with a decision handed down by a regulator statutorily charged with overseeing the operation of a particular market unless [emphasis added by the SFAT] it can be demonstrated that a clear error has been made...Each case obviously will depend upon its particular facts, but it should not be thought that a tribunal of this nature readily will accept invitations to interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the regulator in the field and to substitute its own judgment or assessment of the position unless it can be demonstrated that good and cogent reason exists for so doing.\"\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"We welcome the SFAT’s first decision. It reconfirms the importance of responsible officers of licensed corporations maintaining high standards of integrity, as they are the persons who are ultimately responsible for ensuring their brokerage firms comply with all the relevant laws, regulations and Codes of Conduct administered by the SFC.

Chan accepted this money on the basis that in fact it came from a substantial shareholder of the company who did not have a bank account in Hong Kong.  Chan agreed to return the money to the shareholder’s representatives when they visited Hong Kong to enable them to settle expenses incurred in connection with the company’s listing.\n\nChan also received HK$3 million cash from a friend for safekeeping. Chan then transferred the money received from the company to his friend’s bank account and gave his friend’s cash to the shareholder’s representatives. Chan had no authority from either party to make these transfers.\n\nThe SFC found that Chan should not have accepted payment of HK$2.8 million from the  company into a personal bank account. If he was satisfied that it was appropriate for him to accept the money, it should have been paid into the client’s account at Oriental.  Chan should not have transferred the HK$2.8 million received from the company to his friend’s bank account without authority (notwithstanding that the transfer was subsequently authorised).\n\nFurther, Chan failed to have regard to the Guidance Note issued by the SFC on the Prevention of Money Laundering then in force. In particular Chan failed:\n\n(i) to make adequate enquiries about the source and origin of both the HK$2.8 million and the HK$3 million.\n\n(ii) to question whether it was in fact appropriate for him to accept and hold such funds at all.\n\n(iii) to consider whether the transactions involving the HK$2.8 million and HK$3 million were suspicious and required him to consider filing a Suspicious Transaction Report with the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit.\n\nThe SFC also found that Chan had failed to conduct sufficient due diligence into one of the placees in the listing. Chan knew that shares had been allotted to a placee who had received money from a director of the company. Chan should have considered the issues raised by GEM Rule 11 which requires a certain percentage of shares to be in public hands. A person whose shares have been financed directly or indirectly by a director is not recognised as a member of the public for these purposes. In failing to consider these issues, Chan was negligent.\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “This case is a timely reminder to all those licensed by the SFC that they must adopt an effective and systematic approach when handling money. It is important for licensees to identify potentially suspicious financial activity and where appropriate, to report the activity in order to fulfil their obligations under Hong Kong law and the SFC’s Guidance concerning money laundering.”\n\nEnds\n\nNotes:\n\n1.   During the relevant period, the Money Laundering Revised Guidance Notes (July 1997 edition) were in force.  In April 2003, the SFC issued a new Guidance Note under section 399 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance entitled Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.","known_entities":"Chan Nap Kee, Joseph|Joseph Chan|Nap Kee Chan|Joseph Nap Kee Chan"},{"article_body":"The SFC has suspended for one month the registrations of Mr Lau Siu Keung under the Securities Ordinance and the Commodities Trading Ordinance.

IPO Securities acted as a placing agent in the listings of 13 such derivative warrants between January 2000 and May 2001.

The weekly financial reports submitted to the SFC showed that Pacific Sun’s liquid capital was in deficit throughout the month of October 2003. Pacific Sun was forewarned of its inability to maintain the required liquid capital before the requirement came into effect on 1 October 2003. It was given the opportunity to rectify its liquid capital deficiency, but failed to do so until the SFC threatened to shut down its business immediately by imposing a restriction notice.\n\n\n\nThe SFC decided to revoke the licences of Pacific Sun and Mantel for the FRR breaches.

The SFAT rejected submissions that the infraction should be disregarded and accorded minimal regulatory attention. It noted that this was a repeat offence (Note 3). Little effort appeared to have been made to avoid the liquid capital deficiency, notwithstanding repeated warnings. The SFAT considered that \"the impression that the infraction evinced little concern on behalf of Mantel and Pacific Sun was difficult to avoid\". In light of the previous infraction, the SFAT was surprised that Mantel and Pacific Sun did not see fit to take every possible step to ensure that the relatively modest liquidity requirement was met after the SFC’s repeated warnings.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the SFAT took the view that revocation was a penalty too far and considered the penalty ought not to be permitted to stand. In reaching the decision, the SFAT noted the liquid capital requirement for entities which do not hold client funds, and \"apprehended that its reaction would have been very different if the position had been otherwise\".\n\n\n\nAn SFC spokesman said: \"The SFC respects the decision of the SFAT.

He purchased the shares of these companies at lower prices a few days prior to the publication of his research reports and sold these shares when the share prices increased after publication of his research (Note 2). He conducted these transactions for his father’s account at another brokerage firm where his girlfriend was a dealing director (Note 3).\n\n\n\nWong also failed to disclose to Dao Heng that he was operating his father’s account at another brokerage firm, as he ought to have done. His conduct was in breach of Dao Heng’s staff dealing policy that research staff could not deal in any security that was the subject of research within three weeks before and after the publication of the research.\n\n\n\nBy frontrunning his research reports, he put his and/or his father’s interests above the interests of the investing public, in breach of the conflicts of interest provisions under the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concluded that Wong’s conduct had seriously compromised his role and duty as a research analyst and might affect the independence and objectivity of his research reports. The SFC therefore decided to suspend his licence for 18 months.\n\n\n\nWong applied to the SFAT for a review of the SFC's decision.\n\n\n\nReview by the SFAT\n\n\n\nThe SFAT review hearing took place on 9 July 2004. The SFAT did not discern any merit in Wong's application for review, and dismissed the application at the conclusion of the hearing. As a result, the SFAT affirmed the SFC's decision to suspend Wong for 18 months.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT's Reasons for Determination were issued today. In dismissing Wong’s application, the SFAT made the following comments about research analyst conflicts of interest:\n\n\n\n\"... in practice the analyst acts as the bridge between investor and listed company. Notwithstanding the manifest and much publicized excesses that occurred during the securities 'dot com' boom, many investors still consider analysts an important source of information, and couch their investment decisions accordingly. Clearly it is vital for the maintenance of investor confidence in a securities market that such analysts act with integrity when producing their reports, and an important check and balance in terms of the maintenance of such integrity, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest, lies in the temporal trading restrictions imposed upon analysts contemporaneous with publication of a research reports... It seems to us that the public interest demands firm action of this type on the part of the regulator.\"\n\n\n\nThe SFAT also emphasized the deterrent nature of the disciplinary proceedings:\n\n\n\n\"Disciplinary actions are punitive, and are intended to have a deterrent effect. \"Pour encourager les autres\" is not an inappropriate maxim for a regulator to espouse. Moreover, the point remains that in principle mitigating factors have less resonance within domestic disciplinary regimes as compared with the influence of such factors within the criminal system.\"\n\n\n\nThe SFC welcomes the decision of the SFAT. An SFC spokesman said: \"The public expect research analysts to have high standards of integrity. Research reports and articles written by research analysts have wide readership in Hong Kong, and it is important that the views expressed in these reports and articles are objective, independent, unbiased and accurately reflect the financial prospects of the target companies. They must not be tainted by an analyst’s undisclosed personal interests or dealing in the stocks concerned. The integrity of the market is seriously prejudiced where securities analysts place their personal interests above the interests of the investing public, as Wong did in this case. His desire for him or his father to profit clearly conflicted with his duty to provide objective, independent and unbiased report to the investing public.\"\n\n\n\n\"The recent arrests of analysts who are suspected of having accepted bribes to write favourable reports have focussed the public’s attention on analyst conflicts of interest. This is an important area on which the SFC will focus its enforcement resources. If analysts are found to have allowed their research reports to be affected by their personal interests, the SFC will take disciplinary action,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\n\nA copy of the SFAT's Reasons for Determination is posted on the SFC's website.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

When KGI did employ a manager to supervise one of the branch offices, the manager was inexperienced and lacked adequate training for the job for which he was employed. There was confusion as to the supervisory role of the manager because Yung failed to provide clear delineation of responsibilities. As a result, an unregistered staff member engaged in securities dealing (Note 1). Though Yung made regular visits to the branch office, the unregistered activities were undetected due to poor diligence. The activities were made possible by Yung’s failures to adequately and diligently supervise the management of the office.\n\n\n\nThe SFC further found that there was insufficient control of trading limits at that branch office due to an unclear division of duty in this area. Trading often exceeded the limits in two clients’ accounts and KGI was exposed to unnecessary financial risks. Had Yung exercised due care and diligence in his supervision, the opportunity for trading in excess of credit limits would have been lessened.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Yung has been guilty of misconduct and that his fitness and properness has been seriously called into question. It therefore decides that a suspension is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Lax supervision by Responsible Officers in a brokerage puts the clients and the brokerage at risk.

Infast admitted that there was no system to regularly monitor the dealing activities of staff through listening to the tape recordings of clients’ instructions.

This led to a staff member breaching Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited's Placing Guidelines For Derivative Warrants then in force and conducting personal trades which China Southern could not monitor to prevent conflicts of interest (Note 1). The staff member said he did not disclose the relevant trades because China Southern did not require him to; and\n\n\t- between May 1999 and February 2001, another account executive of China Southern (Note 2) continued to execute trades in five of his clients' accounts when the margin call values exceeded the margin limits for prolonged periods from six to 14 months.

Also, China Southern had a lax credit control policy for which {X} was not responsible.   \n\nIn view of the above failings, China Southern's and {X}'s fitness and properness has been called into question, and the SFC therefore decides to reprimand them.

A written manual listing out the procedures of how to comply with the relevant rules and regulations is a basic requirement.

It posted an offer document to shareholders on 10 September 2003.\n\n\n\nDespite repeated requests by the Executive to do so, GP Nano and its directors never issued an offeree circular to shareholders in response to the offer. Their failure to issue a circular amounts to a serious breach of a fundamental rule of the Takeovers Code (Rule 8.4).\n\n\n\nGP Nano has explained that the failure to issue the circular was due primarily to the action of Mr Fung and Mr Lian, the Chairman and an executive director of GP Nano, who objected to the issue of the circular in view of the financial difficulties faced by the company, the resources and effort involved and the fact that the directors considered the offer to be unsolicited and unappealing. The Executive does not accept that any of these are sufficient reason not to issue a circular to offeree shareholders and neither should have the directors who were presented with this view.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of Rule 8.4 is to provide shareholders with sufficient information, advice and time to reach an informed decision during a takeover offer. GP Nano’s and the directors’ failure to despatch the circular within the time prescribed in Rule 8.4 and its subsequent decision not to despatch the circular at all, prejudiced the interests of shareholders of GP Nano as well as the investing public. Shareholders of GP Nano had not been provided with GP Nano’s corporate and financial information (as required by the Takeovers Code), the board recommendation and advice of the independent financial adviser with respect to the offer. Shareholders were therefore unable to reach a properly informed decision on the offer as envisaged by the Code.\n\n\n\nThe Executive is imposing more severe sanctions on Mr Fung and Mr Lian to reflect the fact that they initiated and led the company’s decision not to issue the circular. It appears that, up to the time when Mr Fung and Mr Lian made their objections known, the remaining directors genuinely intended to issue the circular. The sanctions against those directors reflect their role in the breach and the fact that they collectively and individually failed to take any action to ensure that the circular was issued in compliance with Rule 8.4 nor did they consult the Executive.\n\n\n\nThe Executive would like to remind practitioners that the obligation to issue a circular in response to an offer under Rule 8.4 rests on a company through its directors. Whilst the Takeovers Code recognises that the detailed supervision of any document may be delegated to a committee of the board (as was the case in GP Nano) this does not mean that the remaining directors are absolved from their obligations and duties under the Code including the obligation to issue a circular to shareholders. If there is any doubt about the application of the Code the Executive should be consulted at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe Executive reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary measures against Mr Kwong Chun Kau who has not been contactable since the announcement of the offer in August 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnds","known_entities":"Chiang Chi Kin, Stephen|Chow Chun Kwong|Feng Hui Liu|Fung Chiu|GP NanoTechnology Group Limited|Lian En Sheng|Ong Hong Hoon|Siu Siu Ling, Robert|Chiu Fung|Stephen Chi Kin Chiang|Chi Kin Chiang|Stephen Chiang|Hong Hoon Ong|Siu Ling Siu|Robert Siu Ling Siu|Robert Siu|Hui Liu Feng|Chun Kwong Chow|En Sheng Lian|GP NanoTechnology Group Limited"},{"article_body":"The SFC has successfully prosecuted Miss Tsui Muk Lan for her failure to make proper disclosures of interests.\n\n\n\nTsui today pleaded guilty to nine summonses in relation to her failure to make proper disclosures to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and First Asia Capital Investment Limited of the decrease of her notifiable interests in First Asia on 26 November 2003, and increase of her notifiable interests in First Asia on 19, 24 and 30 December 2003 and 7 January 2004.\n\n\n\nMr Timothy Casewell, a Magistrate at Eastern Magistracy, fined Tsui $18,000 and ordered her to pay investigation costs of $16,033 to the SFC.\n\n\n\nEnds","known_entities":"Tsui Muk Lan|Muk Lan Tsui"},{"article_body":"The SFC has successfully prosecuted Mr Chow Lung On for manipulating the shares of Tern Properties Company Limited.\n\n\n\nChow was convicted today after trial before Mr R.

(Note 1) Both the Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung agreed with the SFC not to act as a sponsor or compliance adviser or perform or carry out any activities for and on behalf of any sponsor or compliance adviser in relation to any Listing Applicant or issuer respectively during these respective periods subject to the same exceptions. (Note 2)\n\n\n\nThese actions in respect of the Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung result from their withholding of material information from the Exchange in early 2003 when they acted as sponsor to a listing applicant to the Growth Enterprise Market. The Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung were found to have failed to properly guide and advise the Listing Applicant with due care and skill so as to provide reassurance to investors.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nIn July 2002, the Listing Applicant submitted its application to list on GEM (\"Listing Application\") through the Sponsor, with Mr Rabo Leung acting as the Sponsor’s Principal Supervisor. The Listing Application was approved in principle by the Listing Committee in October 2002 and the approval-in-principle was re-confirmed in January 2003.\n\n\n\nFacts\n\nIn mid January 2003, the Sponsor informed the Division that (i) the listing timetable was postponed (\"Delay\") because the Listing Applicant’s auditors (\"Initial Auditors\") could not issue the accountants’ report on time as a result of a change in their partner-in-charge, and (ii) as the Initial Auditors’ new partner-in-charge could not commit on the time span for reviewing the Listing Applicant's accounts, the Initial Auditors agreed to resign as auditors and reporting accountants and the Listing Applicant would appoint another firm of auditors to be its new auditors and reporting accountants (\"New Auditors\").\n\n\n\nIn late February 2003, the Sponsor re-submitted the Listing Application together with a draft prospectus containing a revised accountants’ report prepared by the New Auditors. The Sponsor advised in its cover letter that the content of the prospectus was substantially the same as that approved in January 2003, except that the accountants' report was prepared by the New Auditors instead of the Initial Auditors, and there was no material change in the new accountants' report apart from the extension of the financial report period.\n\n\n\nIn early March 2003, the Sponsor specifically confirmed that, save as disclosed in the prospectus, there were no other major issues which ought to be brought to the attention of the Listing Division in relation to the Listing Application. However, the Listing Applicant's draft prospectus did not mention the reasons for, or include any statement of the fact of, the change in reporting accountants.\n\n\n\nIn mid March 2003, the Sponsor repeated the reasons for the Delay and the Initial Auditors' resignation, and, at the Exchange's request, provided the Initial Auditors' professional clearance letter. From the clearance letter, the Exchange noticed that the Initial Auditors had resigned at the request of the Listing Applicant.\n\n\n\nAt the Exchange’s specific request, the Sponsor on 20 March 2003 submitted the Initial Auditors’ resignation letter dated 27 January 2003. The Exchange then discovered that the Initial Auditors stated that their resignation was a result of unresolved differences between them and the Listing Applicant since early January 2003 over certain sales transactions that represented about 17.5% of the Listing Applicant’s turnover (\"Sales Transactions\"). The Sales Transactions were included and approved in October 2002 in the accountants’ report prepared by the Initial Auditors. The Exchange also discovered that prior to the re-submission of the Listing Application, the Initial Auditors had identified new concerns about the Sales Transactions in early January 2003 and up to their resignation, the Initial Auditors had been unable to determine the appropriate treatment of the Sales Transactions either in the accountants’ report in the prospectus or in subsequent audited accounts, and therefore indicated that they needed to perform further procedures on the Sales Transactions before they could sign off the accountants’ report. The New Auditors had, prior to their appointment on 12 February 2003, performed certain procedures to satisfy themselves that the accounting treatment of the Sales Transactions in the Listing Applicant’s audited accounts would not render those audited accounts misleading, and on that basis submitted a draft accountants’ report with the draft prospectus attached to the Listing Application dated 25 February 2003.\n\n\n\nAfter the Exchange became aware of the issue regarding the Sales Transactions, vetting of the Listing Application included enquiries relating to this issue. The Listing Application was eventually rejected, in part because the Sponsor did not satisfactorily address the Division’s concerns on the inconsistencies in the facts presented with respect to the Sales Transactions. The Listing Applicant has not reapplied for listing.\n\n\n\nThe Listing Committee's decision\n\nAs part of a settlement with the Exchange, the Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung did not contest the Exchange’s allegations concerning the breaches of the standards of conduct described in Rules 6.03 and 6.39 of the GEM Listing Rules, as well as the Sponsor’s Undertaking to the Exchange in Appendix 5A of the GEM Listing Rules and agreed to the Listing Committee imposing the sanctions set out above on them.\n\n\n\nSFC’s decisions\n\nIn light of these alleged breaches, the SFC entered into a settlement agreement with the Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung. Under the agreement, the SFC agreed not to take further disciplinary action against the Sponsor and Mr Rabo Leung given their respective undertakings not to perform or carry out sponsor and compliance adviser functions.\n\n\n\nComments\n\nMr Richard Williams, the Exchange’s Head of Listing and Secretary to the Listing Committee, stressed that the Exchange places reliance on sponsors in initial listing applications and take comfort from the representations and due diligence of sponsors. \"It is incumbent on sponsors to be completely frank and open in their dealings with the Exchange in relation to listing applications. Any failure to do so undermines the Exchange’s confidence in the work of the sponsor and the relationship of trust which is fundamental to the smooth processing of listing applications,\" said Mr Williams.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"The Exchange, the Listing Committee and the investing public rely on sponsors to give appropriate advice and guidance to a new applicant in its preparation for a listing. Sponsors have an important role in making sure that only complete and accurate information is provided to the Exchange and the Listing Committee so as to facilitate their assessment of the suitability of the new applicant for listing. In discharging their duties, sponsors must act with due skill, care and diligence and in an open and candid manner with regulators. Mr Rabo Leung and the Sponsor’s conduct falls short of the standard expected of them and warrants suspensions. Sponsors’ failings remain one of the SFC’s enforcement priorities and the SFC will take strong action against similar failings.\"\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

Instead, he conducted an off-market cross trade with another client of CLSA and verbally confirmed with the clients that the order had been executed. In fact the order was not yet input to and registered with the Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited. There were no records to show that the off-market cross trade had been concluded.\n\nThe market dropped sharply on that day and Thomas was unable to register the cross trade into the trading system at the specified price. To rectify the position, he registered a cross trade with the same order size through the trading system prior to the market closing on that day, but at a lower price (Trade 1). The trade was booked into the client’s account without the client’s knowledge and consent as to the alteration in execution price. At the market opening on the following day, he used CLSA’s house account to execute a number of orders at higher prices which pushed up the options price and eventually executed another cross trade with the same order size at the client’s specified price on the previous day (Trade 2). Trade 1 was cancelled and Trade 2 was booked to the client’s account.\n\nThomas did not inform the client of these material discrepancies, as he ought to have done. Thomas acted in breach of the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.\n\nThe SFC also found that, in pushing up the prices, Thomas had recklessly created a false and misleading appearance as to the price of the options. Rule 517 and Rule 519 of the Rules of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange forbid manipulative orders by Exchange Participants. Thomas’ orders were manipulative and out of range with the market price, and might have misled other market participants who might rely on the transaction price as their parameter for trading.\n\nFurther, Thomas was found to have breached the Code of Conduct and CLSA Futures’ internal control policy by failing to record the order for the client and to time stamp the dealing ticket at the time of receipt and execution of the order. This failure obscured the proper audit trail of the client’s order.

The unregistered dealing activities were made possible by KGI’s lax internal control over the management of its branch offices.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that KGI had failed to employ any staff to supervise the operation of two of its branch offices for several months in 2000, exposing the firm itself to management risk. When KGI did employ a manager to supervise one of the branch offices, the manager was inexperienced and insufficiently trained. There was confusion as to the supervisory role of the manager because there was no clear delineation of responsibilities. As a result, an unregistered staff member engaged in securities dealing (Note 1). Though KGI’s directors made regular visits to the branch office, the unregistered activities were undetected due to poor diligence.\n\n\n\nThe SFC further found that there was insufficient control of trading limits at that branch office due to an unclear division of duty in this area. Trading often exceeded the limits in two clients’ accounts and KGI was exposed to unnecessary financial risks. Further, account executives were given latitude in the control of the trading limits based on their own risk assessment, which lacked uniformity, objectivity and supervision. When an automatic interdiction system was later installed to prevent trading over limits, it still allowed manual circumvention.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that KGI has been guilty of misconduct and that its fitness and properness has been called into question.

That review has shown that, at the relevant times, there were internal control weaknesses at CLSA (which CLSA has since remedied) which were exploited by Yeung to enable him to commit and conceal his fraudulent activities. In particular:\n\n\n\nthere should have been a segregation of duties so that Yeung was not responsible for both processing transactions and reconciliation of positions;staff should have been reminded of the importance of ensuring strict adherence to procedural guidelines, and in particular those relating to computer access and security;staff should have been required to take their full holiday entitlement as it can provide the employer with an opportunity to detect fraudulent conduct;CLSA should have ensured that the stock reconciliations and calculation of dividend and bonus share entitlements of clients which were conducted by Yeung were independently verified;CLSA’s own pool of securities, securities holdings at other locations and infrequently traded accounts should have been monitored on a regular basis. Yeung’s access to these enabled him to steal stock from CLSA and cover up the theft;transfers of stock by staff members for their personal account should have been more closely monitored as this could have indicated Yeung’s wrongful activities;the internal audit controls, as well as the resources committed by CLSA to supervision of certain settlement staff at the relevant times, were not adequate as a result of which the fraudulent activities of Yeung went undetected for too long;due to system limitations, CLSA failed in certain instances to maintain an audit trail of changes to client standing data, these limitations have since been rectified;CLSA should have examined and evaluated the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal controls to detect fraud; andCLSA should have ensured at the relevant times, more adequate planning, control and recording of all audit and review work performed and should have also ensured that risks highlighted in internal reports were followed up and resolved satisfactorily.\n\nThe SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of CLSA has been called into question. In deciding its action, the SFC has taken into account the fact that CLSA has implemented the recommendations proposed by the independent accounting firm to additionally improve its internal control systems as well as the supervision and monitoring of the work of its employees. The independent review notes that since the company began its system upgrades in 2000, a number of system and operational changes were in process, which if implemented would have rectified most if not all the weaknesses. CLSA has notified the 32 known staff, affiliate, client and inactive accounts affected and also pledged to notify any additional clients affected by the misappropriation and credit their accounts with the shortfall amounts and has undertaken to the SFC to compensate future claimants for loss caused by Yeung’s theft. The SFC acknowledges that CLSA has taken internal disciplinary action against individuals whose failings unwittingly facilitated the misappropriation by Yeung (Note 2).\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Intermediaries must ensure that they have effective internal control procedures and that their staff are properly supervised and monitored in order to adequately safeguard client assets. With proper internal control, fraud and misconduct such as misappropriation can be detected at an earlier stage or prevented altogether. We will take disciplinary action against companies that fail to put in place adequate internal controls.\"\n\n\n\n\"For a long time, the SFC has reprimanded brokerages for similar failings. Yet, we continue to come across this type of cases all too often. It therefore appears that reprimands are proving to be an inadequate deterrent. Under the SFO, the SFC may fine and partially suspend or revoke licences. In future, in cases of internal control and supervision failings facilitating serious misconduct harming clients, the SFC will consider imposing heavier sanctions.

The dealing director, who is meant to take responsibility for supervision and regulatory compliance, was an appointee in name only and spent almost all her time on the Stock Exchange trading floor. She felt that, as all the staff had been with S&C for a long time, they were all trustworthy and did not need supervision. {X}, the owner and a director of S&C, appointed this dealing director not for carrying out supervisory functions but merely to fulfill the SFC's licensing requirements that each brokerage must appoint a dealing director.\n\n\n\n{X} and other directors played almost no supervisory role in S&C. She felt that all employees had been with S&C for a long time and were familiar with S&C's operation and did not need supervision. Even worse, almost all S&C staff knew or should have known the settlement clerk was dealing while unlicensed. It was the ability of the settlement clerk to both deal and settle trades, together with the lack of supervision, that allowed the settlement clerk to engage in her conduct.\n\n\n\nAt the SFC's request, S&C engaged an independent accountant firm to comprehensively review its internal control procedures. The independent accountant identified a number of serious weaknesses in S&C, which facilitated that settlement clerk's dishonest act. These included:\n\n\t- failure to segregate settlement and operation of second terminal functions;\n\n\t- failure to implement effective internal and compliance systems;\n\n\t- failure to maintain comprehensive audit trails of trading orders;\n\n\t- failure to deliver trading documents to clients;\n\n\t- inadequate account opening controls;\n\n\t- inadequate clearing and settlement procedures; and\n\n\t- inadequate control procedures on access to internal computer system, second terminals and CCASS terminals.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that S&C and {X} had failed to discharge their functions properly in managing and supervising the operations of S&C.\n\n\n\nIn deciding to severely reprimand S&C and reprimand {X}, the SFC has taken into account that S&C has implemented fully the accountant's recommendations, appointed a responsible officer to be responsible for compliance matters and has purchased replacement stocks to compensate clients who suffered loss.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"This is one of the worst cases that we have seen of poor internal controls and inadequate supervision in a brokerage permitting staff misconduct.

During the investigation, it was discovered that WP Chan and Wan had participated in and profited from trading malpractices through their own accounts or through accounts they controlled at Hing Wai.

Halsburg introduced the ASF to its clients between August 2001 and May 2002. Hui received commissions made in selling the ASF. Although at all times Hui was responsible for conducting due diligence, he was unaware that overseas regulators had published warnings about the Imperial Consolidated Group (IC Group), to which ICM belonged (Note 2). The SFC found that the information should have been readily available to Hui and he should have disclosed the facts of these warnings to his clients.\n\nIn early 2002, Hui became aware that ICM faced liquidity problems because of large redemption requests in relation to ICM. But Hui did not disclose this material and relevant information to his clients. By not disclosing unfavourable information to his clients when he sold the ASF, he placed himself in a conflict of interests. He was grossly negligent and his ability was seriously called into question.\n\nFurther, in mid 2002, the ASF was suspended and both ICM and the IC Group were liquidated. But Hui only informed the clients of these matters in late 2002, which was unreasonably late as he had known of its suspension since mid 2002.\n\nHui also introduced another investment product managed by Alpha Toronto Series Inc in June and August 2002 to several overseas intermediaries although he knew or should have known that the management of this product were closely related to the IC Group (Note 3).\n\nThe SFC concludes that Halsburg and Hui are guilty of serious misconduct and that their fitness and properness has been called into question. The SFC decided to revoke the licences of Halsburg and Hui. They appealed to the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal against the SFC’s decision, which was withdrawn following negotiations. Hui agreed to accept the suspension, resign as a director of Halsburg and refrain from being involved in Halsburg’s management and operations.\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Investment advisers should be vigilant in performing due diligence on products that they promote. Clients rely on their advice when they invest and therefore investment advisers have a duty to act with due care, skill and diligence. They must always act in the best interest of their clients and avoid conflict of interests.\n\n“Hui should have disclosed all material, relevant information, whether favourable or otherwise, to his clients, so that they had a choice as to what they should do about their investments. Hui’s conduct was extremely serious and a serious penalty is warranted.”\n\nEnds\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

The SFAT has reduced the length of the suspension after Barber put forward important new evidence at the hearing.\n\n\n\nBarber was a deemed licensed representative and responsible officer of Barber Asia Limited (Note 1).\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nOn 17 June 2003, a judgment was entered against Barber Asia Limited (BAL) in the civil proceedings that one of its clients, Ms Susan Field, had brought against the firm. BAL was held liable in negligence for losses suffered by the client. The Court of First Instance in those proceedings concluded that Barber had negligently advised the client, causing her financial loss.\n\n\n\nThe subject matter of the civil suit was an investment product known as a \"Loan and Guarantee Scheme\", which the client entered into in reliance on Barber’s advice in August 1998. The scheme involved the client gearing her original investment by assigning it to a lender as security for a loan, the proceeds of which would be used to acquire another investment, which would also be assigned to the lender as security for the loan. The essence of the scheme was a borrowing in Japanese Yen for investment in Pounds Sterling, and a gearing factor of 2.5 times being applied to the client’s original investment. Following a substantial appreciation of the Yen, the client was required to make additional margin payments (i.e. to provide extra collateral to secure the gearing loan). When the client decided to close out her whole position in early December 1999 after repeated margin calls, she received back less than a quarter of the value of her original investment.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of the Court of First Instance judgment, and having taken into account detailed representations submitted on Barber’s behalf before and after the dismissal by the Court of Appeal in September 2004 of BAL’s appeal against the Court of First Instance judgment, the SFC found that the negligent advice Barber gave his client had called into question his fitness and properness.\n\n\n\nReview by the SFAT\n\n\n\nThe SFC decided to suspend Barber’s licence for six months in September 2004. Barber appealed to the SFAT. Taking into account new oral and documentary evidence put forward by Barber, which he had not submitted during the civil proceedings in the High Court or the SFC disciplinary proceedings, the SFAT reached factual findings which are different from those of the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the SFC and which are more favourable to Barber.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT held that Barber had been insufficiently diligent in explaining to his client the downside risks of the investment he had introduced, and that he had failed to properly assess the suitability of this investment to this particular client. However, in view of the new factual findings, the SFAT reduced the length of the suspension to one month (Note 2).\n\n\n\nThe SFAT’s Reasons for Determination confirm that express warnings on the face of the investment product documentation do not absolve an investment adviser from their duty to properly explain the risks involved to the client. Although the SFAT accepted that Barber had gone over the documentation with the client, the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC requires an investment adviser, when providing services to a client in derivative products, including futures contracts or options, or any leveraged transaction, to assure themselves that the client understands the nature and risks of the products and has sufficient net worth to be able to assume the risks and bear the potential losses of trading in such products.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT also rejected Barber’s argument that the fact that the client concerned was an \"Execution Only\" client (Note 3) was in itself sufficient to divest the investment adviser of responsibility for any advice given.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Substandard investment advice remains an enforcement priority. The SFAT decision has confirmed that breaches of the diligence and suitability requirements under the Code of Conduct deserve serious sanctions. The Code of Conduct requirements of diligence and suitability apply whenever a licensee makes a recommendation or solicitation, including where the client is an \"Execution Only\" client. In appropriate cases, the Securities and Futures Ordinance now also empowers the SFC to fine people guilty of mis-selling.\"\n\n\n\nA copy of the SFAT’s Reasons for Determination is posted on the SFAT’s website (http://www.sfat.gov.hk).\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\n\n\n1.

Neither BAL nor Barber applied for a full licence under the SFO, and their deemed licences expired on 31 March 2005.

The acquisition accounted for all the daily market turnover of the two warrants on 18 trading days and 1 trading day respectively. \n\nThe SFC found that Tang had accepted the suspicious orders from the two clients and failed to report to the management of BNP the irrational trading by the clients.  Although Tang detected the irregularity of the transactions and made enquiries with the clients, he did not draw any of these matters to the attention of BNP.  Even though the acquisition of the warrants by the clients did not make any economic sense, Tang did not pursue the matter further and continued to take the clients’ orders to trade in the warrants. \n\nAs a licensee, Tang should have alerted his supervisor and reported the matter to the management of BNP on detecting the unusual circumstances in which the clients had traded.  He should also have made reasonable enquiries with his clients if he suspected possibly illegal or improper trading by his clients.  Had the clients failed to satisfy Tang on reasonable grounds that the trades were legal or proper, Tang should have ceased to trade on behalf of them.\n\nThe SFC concludes that Tang’s fitness and properness has been called into question.  In the interest of the investing public and in the public interest, the SFC has reached a settlement with Tang by suspending his licence for three and a half months.  In reaching the settlement, the SFC has taken into account the following factors:\n\n\n\nTang co-operated with the inquiries and accepts full responsibility for his actions;\n\nTang admitted breaching General Principle 2 of the Commission’s Code of Conduct and BNP’s Compliance Manual and the account monitoring procedures.  However, the SFC accepted that there was no dishonesty on the part of Tang in committing these breaches;\n\nTang has a clean disciplinary record; and\n\nTang was not knowingly involved in market manipulation or any other misconduct.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “When licensees receive suspicious orders from their clients, they must not accept them unless they are satisfied with the propriety of the orders. If the clients refuse to explain their instructions to the satisfaction of the licensees, they must refuse to execute the orders and notify their supervisors or the management accordingly.

In effect, Lau stole the complainant’s identity to trade in his name. At the relevant time, Lau was a dealer’s representative for CAPS.\n\n\n\nThe complainant had given Lau a copy of his identity card to open an account with CAPS. The complainant later changed his mind and told Lau that he did not want to open the account and asked Lau to destroy the copy of his identity card. However Lau used it to open an account in the complainant’s name.\n\n\n\nLau traded in the account resulting in substantial losses which CA Pacific Finance Limited’s (CAPF) liquidators had pursued the complainant for, thinking that they were his debt, rather than Lau’s.\n\n\n\nThe complainant did not know about the account or trades in the account. Lau gave his own address as the client address on the account opening documents and therefore the complainant received no communications from CAPS or CAPF’s liquidators. The complainant only found out about the matter when he received a notice from the Court on 21 October 2002 stating that he owed over $1 million to the liquidators of CAPF as a result of Lau’s trades.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Lau had lied to the SFC in his interviews that he did not know the complainant and that he had no knowledge of the account or the trades in the account.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concluded that Lau had been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness had been seriously called into question, and decided to revoke Lau’s licence and ban him from re-entering into the industry for 10 years.\n\n\n\nLau appealed the SFC’s decision to the SFAT.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT upheld the SFC’s decision and accepted its finding that Lau was dishonest and had abused the trust of the complainant placed in him and that Lau had lied to the SFC (Note 2).\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Honesty is one of the fundamental requirements in licensed persons.

Cheung’s has also been fined $50,000 (Note 1).\n\n\n\nIn February 2003, Cheung’s agreed to be a liquidity provider for the transactions in structured products for a securities firm. Cheung’s was required to ensure that there were sufficient funds in its bank accounts to settle the transactions and there was no limit to Cheung’s liability for the liquidity provision. Between April and September 2003, the securities firm’s average daily net long position was about $10 million. However, on 28 and 29 October 2003, the securities firm’s net long position suddenly jumped to $37 million and $30 million respectively and there were insufficient funds in Cheung’s account to settle the transactions on T+2.\n\n\n\nLun, who was responsible for monitoring the securities firm’s transactions, noticed the liquidity problem and arranged funds to meet the settlement demand on T+2. Before the pre-arranged funds were deposited to the house account of Cheung’s, Lun transferred $12.3 million from Cheung’s clients’ trust account to the house account as a safety measure. The transfer from the clients’ trust account to the house account breached section 5 of the Securities & Futures (Client Money) Rules.

Therefore, when CCASS demanded Cheung’s to settle the securities firm’s 29 October 2003 transactions, the demand was rejected due to an insufficient balance in Cheung’s account on 1 November 2003.

Guotai Junan also had other internal control problems which were subsequently rectified (Note 1). The reprimand and fine are the result of a settlement between Guotai Junan and the SFC. The SFC considers the settlement to be in the public interest and in the interests of investors.\n\n\n\nIn October 2003, Guotai Junan took out bank loans to finance clients’ applications for the IPO of PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited. The amount lent to its clients had an effect on the statutory liquid capital requirement and Guotai Junan overlooked the effect. As a result, Guotai Junan’s liquid capital fell below the statutory requirement by $55 million on 30 October 2003. The deficit was rectified afterwards.\n\n\n\nThe SFC also found that, between December 2002 and November 2003, Guotai Junan inadvertently deposited client money with three overseas banks that were not authorised financial institutions under the Banking Ordinance, hence breaching the Client Money Rules. Further, the deposits with two banks had to be treated as ranking liabilities under the Financial Resources Rules (FRR), which caused deficits in the required liquid capital from March to October 2003. The funds held with such overseas banks were ultimately maintained in bank accounts in authorised financial institutions in Hong Kong. Those funds were withdrawn by Guotai Junan as soon as practicable once the breaches were identified. Guotai Junan also strengthened its internal control procedures to prevent the recurrence of such inadvertent errors.\n\n\n\nThe SFC further identified other minor internal control problems at Guotai Junan. However, the SFC notes that Guotai Junan has since rectified these problems and strengthened its internal control procedures to prevent the recurrence of such problems.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Guotai Junan has been guilty of misconduct and that its fitness and properness has been called into question. In deciding on the penalty, the SFC has taken into account the Disciplinary Fining Guidelines (Note 2) and all the circumstances of the case, including the following:\n\n\n\n(i) all of the breaches were unintentional;\n\n\n\n(ii) Guotai Junan had taken remedial action and had strengthened its internal control system to prevent recurrence of the breaches;\n\n\n\n(iii) no loss or damage was suffered by clients, market users or the general public;\n\n\n\n(iv) Guotai Junan made extra profits as a result of the overseas deposits and the excessive margin lending;\n\n\n\n(v) Guotai Junan promptly reported the FRR breaches to the SFC in accordance with section 146 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance;\n\n\n\n(vi) Guotai Junan had at that time sufficient resources to finance its business operation;\n\n\n\n(vii) Guotai Junan has co-operated with the SFC throughout the SFC’s investigations.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"Compliance with the FRR and the Client Money Rules affords protection to the investing public.

The SFC considers the settlement to be in the public interest and in the interests of investors.\n\nThe reprimand and payment stemmed from an inquiry into a case reported to the SFC by Henyep in May 2003 in which a former employee of Henyep was accused of stealing a client's stocks valued at around $1.47 million since 1997 (Note 2).\n\nIndependent auditors appointed at the SFC's request to investigate Henyep found that Henyep had internal control problems.

Lam is suspended from 3 October 2005 to 2 July 2006. Yam is suspended from 3 October 2005 to 2 April 2006.\n\n\n\nAn SFC investigation into suspected market manipulation of three warrants during the period 28 November 2001 to 20 August 2002 (the relevant period) found that the prices of the warrants had risen rapidly since their flotation to levels higher than those of their underlying stocks. Considering that the conversion ratio of the warrants was one to one (i.e. one warrant to be converted into one ordinary share), no sensible investor would be interested in buying the warrants at these price levels since, apart from the cost of the warrants, he would have to pay the exercise price for converting the warrants into shares.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, four corporate clients of TISCOHK actively dealt in the warrants during the relevant period. These clients bought the warrants at prices above those of their underlying stocks on 48 trading days within the relevant period. These acquisitions accounted for more than 90% of the daily market turnover in the warrants on 44 days.\n\n\n\nUpon receipt of clients’ dealing instructions, TISCOHK’s staff did not ascertain basic information relating to the warrants, such as the gearing ratio and premium. Although Lam and another responsible officer of TISCOHK reviewed the clients’ transactions, Lam failed to detect the irregular features of the transactions, whereas the other responsible officer, despite having identified the unusual transactions, failed to make reasonable enquiries with the clients. This second responsible officer is no longer employed by TISCOHK. The SFC attributed the acts of the two responsible officers to the company, as they were the only responsible officers and the company’s directing mind and will. Yam, being the main dealer responsible for executing the clients’ orders, failed to inform the clients of the irregularities of their transactions or report his observation to his supervisor, even though he knew that the clients had been buying the warrants at prices higher than those of their underlying stocks.\n\n\n\nWhere an irregularity in trading is noted, staff of TISCOHK should make reasonable enquiries with the clients whether there is an error in the dealing instructions and advise the clients of the irregularity accordingly. If there is no error, staff should ask the reason for the transactions to determine if they are legal and proper. If the clients fail to satisfy the staff on reasonable grounds that the trades are legal or proper, the staff should cease to trade on their behalf.\n\n\n\nIn light of the above findings, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of TISCOHK, Lam and Yam has been called into question and decides to reprimand TISCOHK and suspend Lam and Yam. In reaching this decision, the SFC has taken into account that:\n\n\n\nTISCOHK has adopted new procedures to monitor its clients’ trading activities;\n\nTISCOHK, Lam and Yam co-operated fully with the SFC in the conduct of its investigation; and\n\nneither TISCOHK nor any of its employees was knowingly involved in market manipulation or any other misleading or deceptive conduct.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “In conducting its business activities, a licensee should act with due skill, care and diligence, in the best interests of its clients and the integrity of the market. In certain circumstances, the acts of the responsible officers will be imputed to the licensed corporation. Responsible officers should not turn a blind eye to the activities of their staff or clients. Failure by the responsible officers to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct by their staff is likely to subject the licensed corporation to disciplinary action.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

The actions are the result of a settlement between Bright Smart, Chan and the SFC (Note 1).\n\n\n\nFollowing an investigation, the SFC found that Chan had knowingly allowed an unlicensed member of staff to conduct securities dealing activities from 4 May 2004 to 6 August 2004.

It has also reprimanded Mr Chan Sum Fat, a responsible officer of Onshine, and fined him $16,700 for the internal control weaknesses in Onshine and inadequate supervision of staff (Note 1).\n\n\n\nBreaches of the FRR\n\n\n\nAn SFC investigation revealed that Onshine had a liquid capital deficiency on a total of five business days during the period from 9 to 15 December 2004. The deficiency arose when Onshine drew down a bank loan to finance its clients in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) subscription in December 2004. Onshine became aware of the deficiency on 8 December 2004 and reported this to the SFC by telephone and in writing on 9 December 2004. Onshine also reported to the SFC that it had already injected a subordinated loan of a total of $50 million as of 9 December 2004 to rectify the breach. Pending the formal approval by the SFC of the subordinated loan, there was continuing breach of section 6(1) of the FRR. The SFC approved the subordinated loan on 17 December 2004. Onshine also failed to take steps to prevent the deficiency in spite of an SFC reminder on treatment of IPOs issued in a circular to licensed corporations and in a press release on 29 November 2004.\n\n\n\nInternal control weaknesses and insufficient supervision of staff\n\n\n\nIn another investigation, the SFC found that a licensed representative of Onshine had input a bid order at the price of $20 for the shares of PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited, raising the stock’s nominal price from $8 to $20 during the pre-opening session on 6 November 2003. The order was cancelled in less than a minute. The licensed representative claimed that it was an erroneous order and did not report it to Onshine. Onshine had no procedures in place to require its staff to report erroneous orders and trades.\n\n\n\nThe SFC also found that another licensed representative of Onshine had input numerous bid and ask orders, each for one million PICC shares, which were cancelled almost immediately during the normal trading session on the same day. The licensed representative said that this was to “test his luck”. He was under stress due to personal reasons at that time and believed that he would be lucky if he was able to cancel the orders before they were executed. He had no means and no intention to buy or sell those shares. He admitted that the trades might have misled investors. He also failed to submit “order journals” printed from his terminal to Onshine and hence failed to maintain an orderly audit trail (Note 2).\n\n\n\nOnshine failed to have in place an internal control policy to require the reporting of erroneous orders. As a responsible officer, Chan was negligent in supervising the two licensed representatives because he did not review their “order journals” to check for any irregularities. Both Onshine and Chan breached the Code of Conduct and Management, Supervision and Internal Control Guidelines for Persons Registered with or Licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Onshine and Chan have been guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness has been called into question.\n\n\n\nIn deciding the penalty, the SFC has taken into account the Disciplinary Fining Guidelines (Note 3) and all the circumstances of the case, including the fact that:\n\n\n\nthe FRR breaches were inadvertent;\n\nOnshine reported the FRR breaches to the SFC at the earliest possible time;\n\nOnshine rectified the position by the injection of a subordinated loan from a related company;\n\nOnshine has no record of prior FRR breaches;\n\nthe licensed representative who input numerous orders to “test his luck” is no longer allowed to operate a terminal;\n\nOnshine has appointed an external auditor to conduct an internal control review;\n\nChan who had a clean disciplinary record was remorseful; and\n\nOnshine and Chan co-operated fully with the SFC’s investigation and in settling the SFC's disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “FRR compliance is vital to ensuring that a broker firm is adequately capitalised and can therefore meet its obligations to clients, other market participants and creditors. This is essential to the stability of the industry as a whole.”\n\n\n\n“A broker firm should also put in place internal control guidelines to require reporting of erroneous orders input by its staff. Failure to do so would put the firm in an unfavourable position if there were disputes from clients about such orders. The firm should also ensure adequate supervision of orders input by its staff in order to detect any irregularities. The firm’s senior management bear primary responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of appropriate standards of conduct and adherence to proper procedures by the firm. Chan’s failure to supervise his staff and to detect the abnormal orders posed settlement risks to Onshine and misled other investors as to the demand for and the price of the stock in question. Chan deserves a reprimand and a fine for his negligence,” Mr Linning added.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

On 10 March 2005, the Insider Dealing Tribunal (IDT) unanimously found that Mr Leonard Carlton Poon and his wife, Ms Kong Yuen Kwan Jenny, had engaged in insider dealing in the listed securities of HKCBH and HKC in May 1997 (Note 2).\n\n\n\nDuring the investigation, the SFC found that there had been purchases of HKC warrants in Kung’s account at Worldsec International Limited in May 1997. The SFC interviewed Kung twice in May and August 1998 respectively, and Kung informed the SFC that the HKC warrants belonged to him and that it had been his decision to purchase the warrants.\n\n\n\nAfter Kung was informed in early 2001 that he had become an implicated person in the insider dealing inquiry, he revealed to the SFC and the IDT that he had lied to the SFC in the two interviews (Note 3). Kung admitted that Poon, who was a director of Worldsec and an SFC licensee at the relevant time, had asked him to lend his account to Poon for personal trades (Note 4). Poon used Kung’s account to purchase HKC warrants. Kung also admitted that, when he was interviewed by the SFC, he had lied to the SFC at the request of Poon (Note 5).\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers that Kung has breached the Code of Conduct by lying to the SFC and lending his securities account to another licensed person for personal use. The SFC concludes that Kung has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness has been called into question.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “People who are interviewed by the SFC have a statutory duty to provide true and complete answers. It is a criminal offence to provide false and misleading information to the SFC. In addition, licensees who lie to the SFC may also be subject to disciplinary action. This case is further aggravated by Kung lending his securities account to Poon. Kung should have known that Poon, as an analyst and a licensed person, could only trade under the monitoring of Poon’s employer and that Poon probably intended to use Kung’s account to avoid such monitoring. Kung’s lending of his account and his failure to make enquiries with Poon as to the use of the account facilitated Poon’s misconduct.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

The SFC found that the prices of the warrants had risen rapidly after issue to levels higher than those of their underlying stocks. Considering that the conversion ratio of the warrants was one to one (i.e. one warrant to be converted into one ordinary share), no sensible investor would have been interested in buying the warrants at these price levels since, apart from the cost of the warrants, the investor would have to pay the exercise price for converting the warrants into shares.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, a corporate client of Young Champion dealt extensively in the warrants during the relevant period. On 30 trading days within the relevant period, the client bought two of the warrants at prices above those of their underlying stocks. These acquisitions accounted for all the daily market turnover of the two warrants on 14 trading days.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that upon receipt of the dealing instructions from the client, Young Champion’s staff failed to ascertain basic information relating to the warrants such as the gearing ratio and premium. Two dealing directors of Young Champion were aware of the client’s transactions, one of them admitted that, despite being aware of the abnormality in the warrants pricing, he continued to take the client’s orders as he considered that his main concern was the settlement of trades by the client. The other dealing director considered that his job was mainly to execute orders and to check the financial position of the client prior to the execution and market monitoring was the job of the SFC (Note 2). The SFC attributed the acts of the two dealing directors to the company, as they were the only dealing directors of the company at the time and they constituted the company’s directing mind and will.\n\n\n\nAs a licensee, Young Champion has a duty to protect the interests of its clients and the integrity of the market. Where an irregularity was noted, its staff should have made reasonable enquiry with the client as to whether there was an error in the dealing instructions and should have advised the client of the irregularity. If the client failed to satisfy its staff on reasonable grounds that the trades were legal or proper, Young Champion should have ceased to trade on behalf of that client. The SFC also found that Young Champion had failed to put in place appropriate and effective procedures in relation to dealing and related review processes to prevent or detect improper activities. Young Champion should also have procedure in place requiring its staff to check basic information relating to the warrants prior to order execution.\n\n\n\nIn light of the above findings, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Young Champion has been called into question, and decides to reprimand Young Champion.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “In conducting its business activities, a licensee should act with due skill, care and diligence, in the best interests of its clients and the integrity of the market.

In doing so, he also deprived his employer of the opportunity to monitor his trading activities.\n\n\n\nFurther, in opening the trading account in his friend’s name, he provided false information about his friend’s background. Yan said his friend was a merchant when in fact he was a janitor, and exaggerated his friend’s income.

In settling its disciplinary action and deciding the level of fine, the SFC has considered the Disciplinary Fining Guidelines (Note 4) and all the circumstances of the case including the fact that:\n\n\n\nthe degree of breach of the Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines was serious;\n\nHooray Securities was warned twice by the SFC in March and November 2002 in relation to mistakes in FRR computation;\n\nthe number of days on which the FRR was breached was substantial;\n\na responsible officer, who was unqualified to do the FRR computation, was nonetheless responsible for attesting the liquid capital accuracy; and\n\nthere was a clear pattern of mismanagement and inadequate internal control procedures in Hooray Securities.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers the settlement to be in the interest of the investing public and in the public interest, taking into account the following factors:\n\n\n\nthe level of fine sufficiently reflects the gravity of the infractions;\n\nHooray Securities co-operated with the SFC in coming to a settlement; and\n\nHooray Securities has since changed its management team and the two previous responsible officers have left the company.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “The SFC takes a tough view towards failures to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures. In this case, Hooray Securities did not have in place any anti-money laundering controls. Substantial amounts of money were transferred to BVI companies of unknown ownership. Hooray Securities had an obligation to question these suspicious transfers but failed to do so. It is this type of behaviour which endangers the integrity of Hong Kong’s market and financial system. Any similar failures will be dealt with harshly. All market participants are reminded that the failure to report suspicious transactions may attract criminal liability under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance and/or the Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance.”\n\n\n\n“As for the other breaches, the SFC reminds licensees that they should take necessary and appropriate steps to ensure compliance in all aspects of their business. Responsible officers who sign an FRR return will be held responsible for its accuracy. The combined effect of these transgressions, together with Hooray Securities’ past record, highlights some serious management failures within the company.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\n\n\n1.

However, in a letter dated 24 October 2002 and subsequent correspondence with the SFC, Chan withdrew his report and provided misleading information to the SFC with a view to dissuading the SFC from initiating an investigation into the matter.

The accounts of the four BVI companies with Hooray Securities were opened shortly before the transactions. The flow of funds could not be traced beyond the BVI companies because the funds were subsequently transferred out of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nThese transfers were suspicious and were noted by Hooray Securities to be unusual. However, Cho failed to make any inquiries with the sellers into the reason for the transfers in order to fulfil the requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines. Further, Cho did not ensure that Hooray Securities had internal policies or procedures in place to comply with the Guidelines nor had he appointed an officer to be responsible for disclosure by staff members of suspicions about a person, transaction or property.\n\n\n\nBreach of FRR\n\n\n\nHooray Securities failed to maintain the requisite liquid capital on a total of eight days between May 2003 and March 2004 as a result of mistakes in calculating its liquid capital returns. Cho, who was not knowledgeable in calculating FRR, nonetheless signed on the FRR return at month’s end. Cho also failed to act responsibly by:\n\n\n\nhiring an inexperienced member of staff to calculate FRR computations;\n\nfailing to ensure that member of staff was suitably trained and knowledgeable in FRR; and\n\nfailing to adequately supervise that member of staff in FRR computation.\n\n\n\nBreach of Code of Conduct by employee\n\n\n\nBetween July and September 2004, a licensed representative of Hooray Securities breached the Code of Conduct as a result of the failures of Cho to:\n\n\n\nensure tape recordings were maintained for at least three months;\n\nimplement measures to check the handling of orders by account executives by listening to tape recordings and checking order placing records; and\n\nprevent discretionary trades from being conducted before receipt of proper written authorisations from clients.\n\n\n\nLack of Internal Controls\n\n\n\nBetween 27 July 2002 and 20 August 2003, a former sales director of Hooray Securities opened seven accounts in the name of seven persons given by a third party who was not a client of Hooray Securities. Without any written authorisation, the third party gave orders to the director to conduct transactions in the accounts in the shares of New Chinese Medicine Holdings Limited. Of the 30 days when New Chinese Medicine was traded in August and September 2002, the third party placed buy/sell orders through the accounts at the same price on 11 days.\n\n\n\nCho failed to ensure that Hooray Securities had written guidelines or procedures requiring a written authorisation for orders placed by a third party on behalf of an account holder. Further, Cho failed to ensure that somebody at Hooray Securities checked the contents of the calls recorded by the tape recording system to ascertain whether orders had been properly executed.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Cho has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness has been called into question. In deciding the penalty, the SFC has taken into account all the circumstances of the case including the fact that:\n\n\n\nthe degree of breach of the Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines was serious;\n\nHooray Securities was warned twice by the SFC in March and November 2002 in relation to mistakes in FRR computation;\n\nthe number of days on which the FRR was breached was substantial;\n\nCho, who was unqualified to do the FRR computations, was nonetheless responsible for attesting the liquid capital accuracy; and\n\nthere was a clear pattern of mismanagement and inadequate internal control procedures in Hooray Securities.\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “The SFC takes a serious view of failures to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures. Through Cho’s failings as a responsible officer, Hooray Securities did not have in place any anti-money laundering controls. Substantial amounts of money were transferred to BVI companies of unknown ownership. Cho had an obligation to query these suspicious transfers but failed to do so. All market participants are reminded that the failure to report suspicious transactions may also attract criminal liability under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance and/or the Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance.”\n\n\n\n“As for the other breaches, the SFC reminds licensees that they should take necessary and appropriate steps to ensure compliance in all aspects of their business. Responsible officers who sign an FRR return will ultimately be held responsible for its accuracy. The combined effect of the misconduct and Hooray Securities’ past record highlight some serious management failures within the company. As a responsible officer at the time, Cho bears full responsibility for all of Hooray Securities’ failings. The level of suspension adequately reflects the relative gravity of Cho’s misconduct,” Mr Goyne added.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

Ng argued, amongst other contentions, that in making a statement to the SFC under the belief that he was merely assisting the SFC, he was not given a warning that he would be the subject of disciplinary proceedings, therefore making his statements inadmissible for the purpose of later disciplinary proceedings. The SFAT rejected this argument and dismissed the application. In a determination issued today, the SFAT rejected a number of challenges to the SFC’s investigatory process, in particular, the need to provide disciplinary cautions, and upheld the SFC’s findings on Ng’s supervisory failures (Note 3).\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “The SFAT determination highlights Ng’s failings as a responsible officer. All responsible officers have a duty to ensure that they adhere to the Money Laundering Guidelines and are aware of offshore companies acting as sub-underwriters in rights placements as well as keep their firm’s internal controls in order. Further, the SFAT determination strongly backs the SFC’s stance on lengthy suspensions for licensees whose failings, whether deliberate or negligent, facilitated possible listed company float/placement rigging frauds.

The restriction notice prohibits Whole Win from carrying on the business of dealing in securities and from dealing with or disposing of its property and property held on behalf of clients.\n\n\n\nThe administrator has been appointed principally to protect the interests of Whole Win’s clients.

The SFC alleged that Deloitte failed to:\n\n\n\nconduct reasonable due diligence on Codebank’s business prospects;\n\nensure adequate support for many of Codebank’s representations made in its prospectus;\n\nreport the payment arrangement change to the SEHK;\n\nmake due and careful enquiry on Codebank’s declaration before submitting it to the SEHK; and\n\nreport the outstanding listing proceeds and Codebank’s inaccurate declaration to the SEHK in March 2002.\n\n\n\nChia was the principal supervisor for the Codebank Listing. The SFC alleged that he failed to adequately supervise his subordinates to ensure that Deloitte properly discharged its duties as a sponsor.\n\n\n\nIn considering the settlement with Deloitte, the SFC has taken into account Deloitte’s co-operation with the SFC in its investigation and the settlement of the disciplinary proceedings and Deloitte has no previous disciplinary record.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers that it is in the interest of the investing public and in the public interest to settle the disciplinary proceedings against Deloitte and Chia without making any disciplinary findings against them.\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, SFC’s Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “The SFC takes a serious view of sponsor failures. We consider them serious because great importance attaches to the role of sponsors in an initial public offering of listed shares. Sponsors are expected to perform a gate-keeping role because prospective investors look upon the sponsors to vouch for the soundness of the securities and the accuracy of the prospectus. Sponsors ought to make reasonable inquires with professional skepticism and critically assess the reliability of the information and representations provided by the issuer or other experts. Sponsor failures could result in the failure of a listed company which may seriously jeopardise investors’ confidence in the financial markets.\n\n\n\nThe SFC will continue to take tough action against sponsors who fail to meet the required standards and seek to exclude them from the industry for lengthy periods.\n\n\n\nThe SFC and HKEx work closely on all sponsor cases and will continue to do so. We thank the HKEx for their co-operation in this case.\n\n\n\nClearer guidance for sponsors on what due diligence entails came into force on 1 January 2005. Sponsors must comply with these standards or can expect enforcement action. In particular, sponsors must conduct reasonable investigations themselves. They cannot delegate their responsibilities to other parties, in particular lawyers, unless they are areas of recognized expertise the delegates are competent in and the sponsor is not. Sponsors must look beyond legal agreements and representations from the listing applicant’s management to secure reasonably reliable evidence of the underlying business situation.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

The suspension is the result of a settlement between the SFC and Luk (Notes 1, 2 and 3).\n\n\n\nBreach of Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines\n\n\n\nBetween September and November 2001, Hooray Securities acted as the selling broker in a number of significant non-AMS transactions in the shares of:\n\n\n\nKarl Thomson Holdings Limited;\n\nGold Wo International Holdings Limited;\n\nEforce Holdings Limited;\n\nSouth Sea Holding Company Limited; and\n\nFourseas.com Limited.\n\n\n\nFollowing these transactions, a large portion of the sale proceeds (ranging from $39 million to $81 million representing 33% to 60% of sale proceeds relating to each company’s shares) was transferred by the sellers to the accounts of five parties, including four BVI companies, for no discernible reason. The accounts of the four BVI companies with Hooray Securities were opened shortly before the transactions. The flow of funds could not be traced beyond the BVI companies because the funds were subsequently transferred out of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nThese transfers were suspicious and were noted by Hooray Securities to be unusual. However, Luk did not ensure that Hooray Securities had internal policies or procedures in place to comply with the Guidelines nor had he appointed an officer to be responsible for disclosure by staff members of suspicions about a person, transaction or property.\n\n\n\nBreach of FRR\n\n\n\nHooray Securities failed to maintain the requisite liquid capital on a total of eight days between May 2003 and March 2004 as a result of miscalculating its liquid capital returns. Luk failed to act responsibly as he:\n\n\n\nhired an inexperienced member of staff to calculate FRR computations;\n\nfailed to ensure that he was suitably trained and knowledgeable in FRR; and\n\nfailed to adequately supervise him in FRR computation.\n\n\n\nBreach of Code of Conduct by an employee\n\n\n\nBetween July and September 2004, a licensed representative of Hooray Securities breached the Code of Conduct as a result of Luk’s failures to:\n\n\n\nensure tape recordings were maintained for at least three months;\n\nimplement measures to check the handling of orders by account executives by listening to tape recordings and checking order placing records; and\n\nprevent discretionary trades from being conducted before receipt of proper written authorisations from clients (Note 4).\n\n\n\nLack of internal controls\n\n\n\nBetween 27 July 2002 and 20 August 2003, a former sales director of Hooray Securities opened seven accounts in the name of seven persons given by a third party who was not a client of Hooray Securities. Without any written authorisation, the third party gave orders to the director to conduct transactions in the accounts in the shares of New Chinese Medicine Holdings Limited. Of the 30 days when New Chinese Medicine was traded in August and September 2002, the third party placed buy/sell orders through some of the accounts at the same price on 11 days.\n\n\n\nLuk failed to ensure that Hooray Securities had written guidelines or procedures requiring a written authorisation for orders placed by a third party on behalf of an account holder. Further, Luk failed to ensure that somebody at Hooray Securities checked the contents of the calls recorded by the tape recording system to ascertain whether orders had been properly executed.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Luk has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness has been called into question. The SFC considers the settlement to be in the public interest and in the interest of the investing public. In settling the disciplinary action, the SFC took into account all the circumstances of the case including the fact that:\n\n\n\nthe breach of the Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines was serious;\n\nHooray Securities was warned twice by the SFC in March and November 2002 in relation to mistakes in FRR computation;\n\nthe FRR breaches took place on many days; and\n\nthere was a clear pattern of mismanagement and inadequate internal control procedures in Hooray Securities.\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “Failure to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures will subject those responsible to severe disciplinary sanction. Luk failed as a responsible officer to implement any anti-money laundering controls. Substantial amounts of money were transferred to BVI companies of unknown ownership. As a responsible officer, Luk had an obligation to query these suspicious transfers but failed to do so. All market participants are reminded that the failure to report suspicious transactions may also attract criminal liability under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance and/or the Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance.”\n\n\n\n“As for the other breaches, the SFC reminds licensees that they should take necessary and appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and codes of conduct.

The reprimand and fine are the result of a settlement between Celestial, Kwan and the SFC.\n\n\n\nThe disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation into the short selling activities conducted by a client of Celestial who was a former staff member that placed short sell orders directly with dealers of Celestial between 17 October and 11 November 2003 (Note 2).\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s investigation revealed that the written internal policies of Celestial required account executives to check clients’ balances before execution of their sell orders. However, Celestial’s actual practice also permitted dealers to execute clients’ sell orders delivered by account executives first without checking clients’ account information and input account information within 15 minutes after the orders were executed. The unclear administration of policy in Celestial caused confusion to its dealers. As a result, the dealers in this case accepted the orders from the client without checking the account information immediately and Celestial did not detect the short selling activities carried out by the client.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found the following internal control weaknesses of Celestial including :\n\n\n\n● its failure to put in place effective procedures to detect and prevent intra-day short selling; and\n\n● its failure to implement and maintain measures appropriate to ensuring compliance with the applicable law and codes issued by the SFC.\n\n\n\nAt all material times, Kwan was one of the responsible officers of Celestial who was involved in approving Celestial’s internal controls.

The SFC then conducted an unannounced inspection of the firm. Upon questioning by the SFC, Mr Yip Kwok Kay, a Responsible Officer and also the major shareholder of the firm, admitted to the SFC that he had misappropriated client securities and provided falsified statements to the clients concerned, with the admitted shortfall in client securities, as of yesterday (6 August), amounting to about $4.3 million. The SFC also found that the firm had a deficit in required liquid capital as at 30 June 2006, in breach of the FRRs.\n\n\n\nIt appears to the SFC that Wing Yip has dissipated, transferred or otherwise dealt with clients’ property in a manner prejudicial to the interest of its clients and that there might be further such dissipation, transfer or dealing.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers that the issue of a restriction notice is desirable in the interest of the investing public or in the public interest.\n\n\n\nThe SFC will continue to investigate into the case to determine what further regulatory actions may be necessary.

Wong performed the duties of a financial controller at Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited (the company) (Note 1).\n\n\n\nThe company deposited client money into two overseas banks, China Merchant Bank and Guangdong Development Bank, which were neither authorised financial institutions nor approved banks under the FRR. These deposits should have been treated as ranking liabilities in the FRR returns and because of this, the liquid capital of the company should have been in deficit from April to November 2003. The deficits ranged from $32 million to $567 million.\n\n\n\nWong was responsible for reviewing the FRR returns for the responsible officer’s submission to the SFC. He had a duty to verify that the contents were true and correct. But he failed to do so because he did not identify that there were deposits of client money in two unauthorised financial institutions or unapproved banks. As a result, he did not treat the deposits as ranking liabilities under the FRR.\n\n\n\nThe company also breached the FRR on 30 October 2003 because of excessive margin lending in the IPO of PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited, which caused its liquid capital to fall below the required level by around $55 million. Wong was responsible for ensuring that there was sufficient liquid capital arising from the IPO’s margin financing but he failed to do so.\n\n\n\nThe company had no written procedures for the liquid capital computation and for the monitoring of compliance with the FRR. Wong’s failures to diligently review the FRR returns and to implement written procedures were the cause of the firm’s failure to detect the breaches.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that, while employed as a financial controller at the company, Wong did not:\n\n\n\nexercise due care and diligence in performing his duties;\n\nhave or employ effective procedures in performing his duties;\n\ndiligently supervise his staff members; and\n\nensure compliance with the law.\n\n\n\nWong is therefore not fit and proper to be a regulated person. In deciding the penalty, the SFC has taken into account the Disciplinary Fining Guidelines (Note 2) and the following matters:\n\n\n\nthere were altogether breaches of seven provisions of the law;\n\nthe breaches were rectified;\n\nWong has substantial experience in the securities industry;\n\nWong has no previous disciplinary record; and\n\nWong co-operated with the SFC’s investigation.\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “Compliance with the FRR affords protection to the investing public. The breach of these rules may seriously undermine the financial integrity of brokers. Licensed persons must exercise due care, skill and diligence in verifying the information in the FRR returns to ensure their accuracy.

As a result of the SFC’s continuing inquiry, the shortfall now appears to be approximately $10.3 million. There also appears to have been misappropriation of client money amounting to approximately $360,000. As the SFC’s inquiries continue, there may be some further variation in these figures (Note 1).\n\n\n\nIn view of the serious nature of these apparent breaches, the SFC does not consider it to be in the public interest or in the interest of the investing public to permit Wing Yip and its management to verify clients’ positions and handle the return of client assets. The SFC considers there to be a need for independent and experienced professional accountants to administer the affairs of Wing Yip, verify clients’ positions and return securities in a prompt and orderly manner.\n\n\n\nThe order appointing the administrators is an interim order and the matter will come back to the Court for another hearing on 18 August 2006, at which time Wing Yip will have the opportunity to oppose the continuation of the order and to present evidence and arguments.\n\n\n\nWing Yip clients\n\n\n\nThe administrators will send a circular to Wing Yip’s clients by next Monday, 14 August 2006, to explain the circumstances of the company and to request them to submit their claims.\n\n\n\nClients may contact the administrators on their hotline: (852) 2289 2522 during office hours (8.30am – 5.30pm, Monday to Friday), or in writing directed to the office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, 20th Floor, Prince’s Building, 10 Chater Road, Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nSFC’s inquiries into the conduct of Wing Yip and its management will continue.\n\n\n\nThe SFC and the administrators will make further announcements when appropriate.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

On 27 September 2004, Barber lodged an appeal to the SFAT against the SFC’s decision.\n\nAt the SFAT hearing, Barber submitted new evidence which had not been previously submitted to the SFC or the courts in civil proceedings. On 30 June 2005, the SFAT handed down its determination. The SFAT arrived at factual findings which were different from those of CFI in the civil proceedings. The majority of the SFAT agreed with the SFC that Barber had been insufficiently diligent in explaining and amplifying to Ms Field the downside risks of the investment scheme and failed to assess properly the suitability of the investment to Ms Field. However, in view of the new factual findings, it decided to reduce the period of suspension from six months to one month (Note 5).\n\nCourt of Appeal’s ruling\n\nOn 28 July 2005, Barber lodged an appeal against the SFAT’s decision on the ground that, in view of the new factual findings, the SFAT should not have reached the decision to suspend him. He, among other things, argued that he had already gone through the documentation of the investment scheme with Ms Field.\n\nThe Court of Appeal decided that the majority of the SFAT was fully entitled to suspend Barber. The Court considered that it was insufficient for Barber to present an investment product to Ms Field and talk her through the documentation because an investment adviser was not merely an agent or product marketer. As an independent investment adviser, Barber had the duty to diligently assess the suitability of the investment for the particular client and to ensure that she was properly informed of the risks. The Court also considered that an investment adviser not only needed to show the potential gains that might be generated by the investment product in question, he must also emphasise the potential losses that could result from the product, so that the client could make an informed decision as to whether she could afford the risks involved and whether she was prepared to take the risks in light of her investment objectives.\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “The SFC welcomes the Court of Appeal’s decision. The Court of Appeal reaffirms the importance of the twin requirements of “diligence” and “suitability” in the context of giving investment advice. Investment advisers will not be able to discharge their duty by merely showing their client all the documentation and referring the clauses in it to the client. They must do more than that and use their professional judgement to diligently assess whether the proposed investment product is actually suitable on reasonable grounds for the client after considering the client’s financial means and investment objectives. It is also not enough for them to only show the potential gains to the client. They must emphasise to the client all the known potential risks involved in the investment and ensure that the client understands the nature and risks of the investment product so that the client can make an informed investment decision.”\n\n“The investment advising industry should view this case as a strong warning of the standards expected of them in Hong Kong and revise their practices to ensure that they meet those standards. The SFC will continue to take action against those investment advisers who mis-sell products to clients,” Mr Goyne added.\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

BSL and BFL are also fined $30,000 each. The disciplinary actions are the result of a settlement between the SFC, BSL, BFL and Szeto (Note 1).\n\n\n\nA routine inspection of BSL and BFL by the SFC in 2003 found that, from September to November 2003, Szeto had failed to keep telephone recordings of most of the orders placed by two of his clients, including his mother, in their accounts with BSL and BFL. Szeto repeatedly told the SFC that his mother had placed the orders by calling his mobile phone or by attending the office of BSL and BFL in person. He also told the SFC that BSL and BFL did not operate any discretionary accounts when in fact he had been discretionarily trading in his mother’s accounts without her written authorisation or designating those accounts as discretionary accounts as required by the Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Szeto had provided misleading information to the SFC by concealing the discretionary trading arrangement in his mother’s accounts. Szeto had also, in breach of the Code of Conduct, conducted more than two day trades in his mother’s account with BFL without obtaining her prior written approval specifically authorising those trades.\n\n\n\nThe SFC investigation further revealed internal control failings in BSL and BFL, including:\n\n\n\nfailure to put in place proper procedures to ensure their licensed representatives were in compliance with the tape-recording requirement under paragraph 3.9 of Code of Conduct and to keep adequate audit trails of clients’ orders; and\n\nfailure to designate the accounts of Szeto’s mother as discretionary accounts and to implement internal control procedures to ensure proper supervision of the operation of discretionary accounts.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that BSL, BFL and Szeto have been guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness has been called into question.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers the settlement to be in the public interest and in the interest of the investing public. In settling the disciplinary action, the SFC took into account all the circumstances of the case including the fact that:\n\n\n\nthe management of both BSL and BFL was aware that Szeto had conducted discretionary trading in his mother’s accounts and held himself out as responsible for any losses incurred in those accounts;\n\nBSL and BFL have put in place corrective measures regarding recording of clients’ orders; and\n\nafter the SFC’s inquiries, BSL and BFL have obtained written approval from Szeto’s mother for Szeto to trade in her accounts on a discretionary basis.\n\n\n\nMr Eugène Goyne, an SFC Senior Director of Enforcement, said: “We expect licensed persons to provide us with accurate and complete answers at all times. Those who provide the SFC with misleading information could be both criminally prosecuted and disciplined. In addition, any discretionary power granted to an account executive by the client must be in writing. The broker firm's records and the client agreement should designate the account as a discretionary account. These measures are essential for the protection of investors and to ensure that investors are dealing with honest and effective licensees. A higher standard of compliance is expected of Szeto who is a responsible officer of BSL and BFL.”\n\n\n\n“It is also important for licensed corporations to keep adequate audit trails of clients’ orders to protect their clients and the integrity of their dealing practices. Failure to do so may cast doubts on the effectiveness and adequacy of a firm’s internal control procedures and may reflect adversely on its fitness and properness,” Mr Goyne added.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

Yang’s actions fixed and positioned the COP to his advantage in order to enable his auction sell order to match with the auction buy order placed earlier by another market participant at the artificial price of 10,570. As a result, Yang made a profit of about $28,000 through his net short positions (Note 3).\n\n\n\nIn determining the penalty, the SFC has considered Yang’s clear record and his consent to the SFC’s decision.\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Manipulators who rig the opening or closing of the market can expect to be caught by the SFC and this result shows it is simply not worth it.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1. Yang was registered as a dealer’s representative of Top Equity Derivatives Limited and Top Equity Brokerage Limited (now known as Goldbond Futures Limited and Goldbond Securities Limited) at the relevant time. He is currently licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance as a representative to carry on Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activity, accredited to Topmore Commodities Limited.\n\n\n\n2. In June 2000, the HKFE introduced a pre-market opening period, which is a 30-minute period before the normal trading hours. The price discovery mechanism serves to establish an orderly market and to enhance market efficiency. It was designed to maximise the number of contracts to be matched, based on all the orders entered during the pre-market opening periods. Pre-market opening periods are further divided into three different sessions and each session has unique restrictions on order placing and cancellation. An indicative COP is calculated every time an order is placed, changed and cancelled. Orders are received, ranked and matched at a single price, known as the final COP, determined immediately before the expiry of the pre-market opening periods. An auction order is an order where the order price is not specified and the person placing an auction order agrees to accept an execution at the final COP. A limit order is an order where the order price is specified. Execution of an auction order is accorded with a higher priority than a limit order.\n\n\n\n3. In January 2005, the SFC prosecuted Yang for contravening sections 63 and 65 of the Commodities Trading Ordinance (repealed). He was acquitted after trial because the Magistrate was not sure that he had an intention to defraud, a necessary element to establish the offence. Notwithstanding the acquittal, the Magistrate found it was beyond reasonable doubt that Yang was manipulative when he placed the pair of matched limit orders and the purpose was to ensure that the final COP for the HSIU2 contract was fixed at 10,570. On appeal, the High Court decided not to interfere because the Magistrate was entitled to consider that he was not sure about Yang’s intention. However, the Appeal Judge also said that it was surprising not to find that Yang was dishonest and had an intention to defraud in view of the facts that were found.

He told Lam that he understood cold calling was prohibited and asked Lam not to call him anymore.\n\n\n\nDuring the investigation of Lam’s cold calling activities, the SFC also found that Lam had advised his client to simultaneously hold equal long and short positions in the same futures contract but was unable to offer reasonable explanation for his recommendation (Note 3).\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that Lam has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness has been called into question and it has decided to prohibit him from re-entering the industry for three months.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Under the SFO, a licensed person cannot escape the disciplinary regime simply by leaving the industry.

CSC has voluntarily undertaken not to act as a sponsor for any new listing application on both the Main Board and the GEM Board for a period of 13 months with effect from 7 March 2006, and Mr Chiu and Mr Tang have agreed to voluntarily undertake not to act as principal supervisors of CSC for any new listing application for a period of 8 months from 7 March 2006 (Notes 1 & 2).\n\n\n\nThe outcome is the result of a settlement between the SFC and CSC, Mr Chiu and Mr Tang. The SFC and HKEx have cooperated extensively in settling this action (Note 3).\n\n\n\nThe settlement stems from an SFC inspection of the business operations of CSC in early 2005. During the inspection, two listing applications of which CSC was the sponsor were reviewed. The SFC found that CSC had failed to comply with various requirements under the Code of Conduct by failing to act with due skill, care and diligence when performing due diligence into the two listing applications and to ensure that the prospectuses and the submissions made to HKEx were prepared to the required standard. Mr Chiu and Mr Tang were the respective principal supervisors of the two listing applications.\n\n\n\nFirst Listing Application\n\n\n\nIn the First Listing Application, the SFC found that CSC (as sponsor) and Mr Tang (as principal supervisor) either had not paid sufficient attention to the recommendations of their professional advisers or did not perform adequate due diligence work in a number of areas, including:\n\n\n\nthe major suppliers and major customers of the listing applicant;the relationship between the directors and shareholders of the listing applicant and one of its suppliers;whether the listing applicant has complied with applicable PRC regulations in respect of social insurance;the renewal of the business licence of the previous owner of a subsidiary of the listing applicant and therefore the capacity of this party in entering into a contract affecting the subsidiary in question; andthe expiry date of the approval certificates of a number of major products of the listing applicant which certificates were required before the products could be sold.\n\nSecond Listing Application\n\n\n\nIn the Second Listing Application, the SFC found that CSC (as sponsor) and Mr Chiu (as principal supervisor) did not perform adequate additional due diligence work in a number of areas, including:\n\n\n\nthe continuous ownership requirement of 24 months under the GEM Listing Rules in respect of the founders of the listing applicants;the ‘related-party’ relationship of the listing applicant with its agents; andthe disclosure of the ‘connected’ relationship between the listing applicant and its major customers.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Second Listing Application has lapsed.\n\n\n\nInternal control weaknesses of CSC\n\n\n\nIn addition to the failings in conducting due diligence for the above two listing applications, the SFC also found the following internal control deficiencies of CSC:\n\n\n\nCSC did not keep an adequate audit trail of their work by failing to record their discussions and resolutions in relation to due diligence work and prospectus disclosure made in their meetings;some staff members of CSC were named as principal supervisors and assistant supervisors but they were not sufficiently involved in the preparation for listing;CSC failed to prepare a detailed due diligence plan setting out division of work before commencing the due diligence exercise; andCSC failed to provide sufficient training to its new staff.\n\nCSC, Mr Chiu and Mr Tang acknowledge SFC’s concerns and regret that the matters set out above have occurred.\n\n\n\nSFC’s decision\n\n\n\nThe SFC concludes that CSC, Mr Chiu and Mr Tang have been guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness have been called into question. In determining the sanctions, the SFC has taken into account that:\n\n\n\nthey co-operated with the SFC and accepted a resolution of the disciplinary action by settlement; andCSC has agreed to commission an accounting firm to conduct a comprehensive review of its operations and procedures.\n\nThe SFC considers the settlement to be in the interest of the investing public and in the public interest.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Sponsors play a pivotal role in the Hong Kong stock market in that they are responsible for ensuring all relevant information has been disclosed in the prospectuses by listing applicants in an accurate and complete manner so that investors can make informed decisions as to whether to invest in the listed securities. The regulators and the investing public expect sponsors to exercise a high standard of professionalism when sponsoring listing applications. Sponsors must take reasonable care to ensure that the statements made in any submission and draft prospectus are complete and accurate before they submit them to the SFC and HKEx. They should not rely on the SFC or HKEx to verify the contents of the prospectus. They must examine information provided by the listing applicants with professional scepticism. When issues or concerns are raised by professional advisers, the sponsors also have a duty to follow up with them. When there is any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of a statement, the sponsor must not include it in the prospectus since it is a public document which will be read and relied upon by the public.”\n\n\n\n“The present case shows that CSC, Andrew Chiu and Howard Tang had acted negligently when they submitted the two listing applications to HKEx. They failed to take reasonable care to ensure that the contents of the prospectuses and submissions were accurate and complete. This is unacceptable. In recent years, several failed listed companies caused serious losses to investors. They also affected the reputation of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The SFC will continue to take tough action against sponsors who failed to comply with relevant regulations applicable to them, in particular, the Code of Conduct, the Corporate Finance Adviser Code of Conduct, Practice Note 21 to the Main Board Listing Rules and Practice Note 2 to the GEM Listing Rules in relation to due diligence by sponsors,” Mr Linning said.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

This is the result of a settlement between Grand Cathay,{X} and the SFC.\n\n\n\nThe disciplinary proceedings follow an SFC inquiry in which an account executive was found to have placed personal orders and discretionary orders without authorisation in six clients' accounts from November 2002 to April 2003. The account executive also allowed an unauthorised third party to place orders in two clients' accounts. In the course of placing these orders, the account executive also breached Grand Cathay's policy on the telephone recording of orders. Grand Cathay required orders to be recorded on tapes and if the orders were not recorded on tapes, the time of the receipt of the orders had to be recorded on the dealing tickets.{X} as a responsible officer was aware of the account executive's misconduct, which was material, in April 2003 but did not report the misconduct to the SFC until February 2004. There was no adequate system at Grand Cathay to ensure that material breaches were reported to the SFC immediately. Further, there was no adequate system to ensure that breaches of the telephone recording policy by account executives were reported to the management so that proper follow-up action could be taken.\n\n\n\nFrom November 2003 to October 2004, two other account executives were found to have placed orders in three clients' accounts without following Grand Cathay's telephone recording policy.{X} discovered the omissions of the two account executives in late 2003 and early 2004.

The trading accounted for over 70% of the market turnover of Essex Bio-Tech during the period. Their aggressive trading inflated the market price of Essex Bio-Tech by 120% from $0.10 to above $0.22 and boosted its daily turnover over tenfold from about one million shares to over 12 million shares.

Cheung’s orders which were placed without any genuine intention to acquire the shares caused the closing price of the stock to rise by a maximum of 16%. By placing the orders in this way, Cheung intended to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price for dealing in Innovis shares.\n\n\n\nThe investigation further found that Cheung had adopted a similar trading pattern for the KanHan Technologies Group Limited shares on 15, 18, 24 and 29 March 2005, causing the closing price of the stock to rise by a maximum of 26%.\n\n\n\nCheung today pleaded guilty to one summons before Mr Ian Candy, a Magistrate at Eastern Magistracy, for intentionally creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Innovis shares. Cheung agreed that his manipulative trading in KanHan shares be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment, suspended for three years, and fined a total of $30,000. Cheung was also ordered to pay investigation costs of $10,000 to the SFC.\n\n\n\nIn passing the sentence, Mr Candy pointed out that market manipulation is a serious offence, usually meriting the imposition of a sentence of six months’ immediate imprisonment upon conviction after a trial. However, taking into account the fact that this was Cheung’s first offence and that he had admitted the offence during the SFC investigation, the Magistrate ordered the sentence of imprisonment to be suspended.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, welcomed the sentence: \"In this case, the court has again given the clear message that anyone who engages in market manipulation can ordinarily expect to receive a custodial sentence.

The SFC found that Tong had told his ex-employers, BNP Paribas Peregrine Securities Limited and BNP Paribas Peregrine Futures Limited, and the SFC that he had met his client when he opened accounts for him with BNP Securities and BNP Futures. Tong also said it was the account holder himself who had instructed him to use another client’s account to execute his trades when there was insufficient trading limit in his account.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Tong only met his client for the first time after he had received notification of our investigation. The accounts were opened by the account holder’s brother. Without establishing the true identity of his client, Tong opened the accounts at the request of the account holder’s brother and placed orders for him. The account holder himself had never given any trading instruction to Tong. Furthermore, Tong acted on the requests of the account holder’s brother to execute his orders through an account belonging to another client of Tong. The information which was given to BNP and the SFC previously by Tong was false and misleading.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the account holder’s brother was a licensed person at the time. Tong should have obtained a written authorisation from the account holder and the written consent of the employer of the account holder’s brother before he opened the trading account, in accordance with paragraphs 7.1 and 12.2(c) respectively of the Code of Conduct. Tong’s failure to comply with the Code of Conduct exposed BNP to the risk of disputed trades and prevented the other registered person from monitoring the trading activities of its employees.\n\n\n\nIn light of the above findings, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Tong has been called into question. The SFC has decided to suspend his licence.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Opening an account for a person without establishing his true and full identity is clearly unacceptable. Such information is necessary in order to improve the transparency of trading in our industry. In order to protect the interests of his employer and market integrity, Tong should have satisfied the ‘know-your-client’ duties and established the true identity of the account holder before account opening. Likewise, Tong should only accept instructions from the account holder. Accepting instructions from an unauthorised party will put the financial interest of the account holder at risk.”\n\n\n\n “Honesty forms an integral part of our industry. We will never accept dishonesty on the part of licensed persons under any circumstances. Licensed persons have a legal obligation to tell us the truth during the course of our investigation.

The disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation into Yicko Futures’ failure to pay its margin requirement and the variation adjustment to the HKFE Clearing Corporation Limited in September and October 2003 (Note 2).\n\nThe investigation showed that a Client Registered Trader of Yicko Futures had not had adequate margin to support his portfolio in HSI Index options and futures contracts (Note 3). Instead of restricting the Client Registered Trader’s trading activities and reducing the size of his trading portfolio, Chong contributed to the Client Registered Trader’s overtrading by lending him money to foot his margin shortfall. The SFC found that Chong and Yao had failed:\n\nto exercise adequate internal controls over the Client Registered Trader’s activities;\n\nto possess sufficient competence in monitoring the Client Registered Trader’s option trading portfolio;\n\nto effectively monitor the Client Registered Trader’s financial resources;\n\nto assess the appropriate level of margin requirement for the Client Registered Trader;\n\nto enforce its margin policy against the Client Registered Trader;\n\nto notify the regulators of the Client Registered Trader’s failure to meet with his margin requirements; and\n\nto ensure compliance with the Client Money Rules and the Securities and Futures (Financial Resources) Rules.\n\nThe SFC also inspected the business of Yicko Securities and found that Yicko Securities had:\n\nnot promptly collected margin requirements due for collection;\n\nallowed clients to initiate new positions notwithstanding margin deposits were not sufficient to cover existing positions;\n\nmargined clients at below the SEHK’s requirement as a result of an erroneous margining methodology; and\n\nfinanced under-margined clients unintentionally with the surplus funds of other clients in breach of the Client Money Rules.\n\nBoth Chong and Yao were the responsible officers of Yicko Securities at the relevant times. They were directly involved in the management of Yicko Securities and were responsible for its failures.\n\nThe SFC concludes that Chong, Yao and Yicko Securities have been guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness has been called into question. In deciding the penalties, the SFC has considered the following factors:\n\nYicko Futures has ceased business and is the subject of a winding up petition;\n\nYicko Futures’ clients other than the Client Registered Trader were not financially affected;\n\nYicko Securities, Chong and Yao have no previous disciplinary history;\n\nYicko Securities, Chong and Yao co-operated with the SFC in settling the disciplinary action; and\n\nYicko Securities has taken the initiative to engage a compliance consultant to review and strengthen its policies and internal controls.\n\n\n\nThe SFC would have fined Yicko Futures as well if it had remained in business.

Exploiting deviations in market value and fair value may be a risky venture notwithstanding that option positions appear to be hedged. Even the most sophisticated financial models are subject to model and parameter risks. A model may treat a trading position as low risk because of the assumptions made and parameters chosen. These assumptions and parameters have to be critically evaluated in light of circumstances. A licensed corporation should understand and manage the risks involved before engaging in these lines of business. Any investor may go under if his/her financial resources are inadequate to meet with margin calls on short notice. Professional traders are no exception. In this case it is clear that Chong and Yao did not understand the true nature and extent of the risk that the Client Registered Trader had assumed.

On the day of the listing, the Lead Manager upon a written payment request from that company issued five cash cheques totalling over $21 million. Lok collected the cheques and presented them for payment.\n\nOf the approximately $21 million, Lok paid $3 million to an account executive of the Lead Manager, which was said to be compensation made to cover the losses of the latter’s clients in subscribing for the Codebank shares because Codebank’s share price had fallen by 50% on the first day of trading (Note 2). Furthermore, Lok transferred $7 million to the Lead Manager’s bank account to settle the subscriptions for Codebank shares in four of the account executive’s client accounts.\n\nDuring his interviews with the SFC, Lok claimed that he had collected and disposed of the money according to the instructions of the owner of the company and had passed the remaining sum to the owner. However, the owner could not be reached and his whereabouts are unknown to the SFC. The SFC regards the nature and circumstances of the payments as highly unusual and suspicious.\n\nLok also claimed that he did not know who had signed the written payment request and who had signed on the back of the cheques for and on behalf of the company. Lok also represented that the relevant signatures on the back of each of the cheques were already there when he received them. However, evidence showed that Lok had signed on the back of the cheques when presenting them for payment. In addition, there were reasons to believe that Lok had signed the written payment request.\n\nThe SFC concludes that Lok has been guilty of misconduct and his fitness and properness has been called into question.

Chew received commission for handling these trades. The SFC successfully prosecuted Chew on 1 April 2003 (Note 2).\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Sheung, a representative of PT Forex, was responsible for processing the account opening for a number of clients referred to him by Chew. Sheung failed to take reasonable steps to verify the identity of the new clients before opening an account for them. He did not meet with these clients in person nor did he explain the account opening documents to them as required by internal policy of PT Forex. Instead, Sheung signed as a witness to these clients’ signatures on their account opening documents notwithstanding that he was not present at the time when they signed.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s investigation further revealed that Sheung had turned a blind eye to possibly unlicensed foreign exchange trading by Chew. Even though Sheung knew that Chew was unlicensed, he accepted the account opening forms from Chew for processing without queries. After the clients’ accounts were opened, Sheung continued to accept the forms from Chew in relation to these clients for withdrawal of funds and change of correspondence address without making reasonable enquiries. In particular, Sheung had accepted a client’s cash withdrawal form from Chew and passed it to the accounts department for processing without checking the signature of the client. After he had received the cheque from the accounts department, instead of giving it directly to the client, he passed it to Chew in the knowledge that there was no written authorisation granted to Chew by the client to handle matters relating to the client’s account.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the SFC found that Sheung had conducted discretionary trades in two of his clients’ accounts without written authorisation in breach of the Code of Conduct and the condition imposed on his licence. Further, Sheung had used his mobile phone to take clients’ instructions in breach of the employer’s internal policy.\n\n\n\nIn light of the above findings, the SFC concludes that the fitness and properness of Sheung has been called into question and decides to suspend Sheung for three and a half months.

In deciding the settlement terms, the SFC has considered the Disciplinary Fining Guidelines (Note 3) and all the circumstances of the case, including the fact that:\n\n\n\n(1) HKWM\n\n\n\nfully and actively co-operated with the SFC in assisting with the SFC’s investigation; \n\nadmitted its failing and settled this action with the SFC; andtook immediate remedial actions to strengthen its internal controls and compliance system and rectify the failing; and\n\n(2) no pecuniary loss was caused to any clients of HKWM or other parties.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “A licensed corporation has a duty to ensure it and its staff fully comply with all the regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of its business activities.

This is the first time the SFC and the HKMA have cooperated in taking disciplinary action against parties who were, at the material time, licensed persons under the SFO and relevant individuals under the Banking Ordinance since the scheme for regulating securities and futures activities under the SFO and the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance came into force on 1 April 2003.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nDuring an SFC routine inspection at Wing Lung Futures in June 2004, the SFC became aware of certain practices that had been adopted by Wing Lung Futures staff in respect of dealing in futures contracts at the San Po Kong Branch of Wing Lung Bank Limited. An SFC investigation subsequently revealed that, between April 2003 and May 2004, {X1} was an Assistant Manager supervising the San Po Kong Sub-section of the Securities Department of Wing Lung Bank. {X1} and {X1}'s two subordinates were not licensed by the SFC for dealing in futures contracts. However, they accepted instructions from some of the clients at the San Po Kong Branch of Wing Lung Bank to trade in Hang Seng Index Futures, relayed these instructions to Wing Lung Futures' dealing room for execution, and confirmed the execution of trades with the clients (the Arrangement).\n\n\n\nThe SFC and the HKMA found that {X1} failed to recognise that the Arrangement was not in conformity with the requirements of either the Commodities Trading Ordinance or the SFO. He adhered to the Arrangement according to {X2}'s instruction and passed on {X2}'s instruction to his two subordinates. In doing so, {X1} did not comply with the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\n\n\n{X2}, the Head of the Securities Department of Wing Lung Bank as well as a responsible officer of Wing Lung Futures, instructed his three subordinates including {X1}, to carry out the Arrangement without taking sufficient steps to verify its legality. In doing so, {X2} did not comply with the Code of Conduct and did not exercise due care to consult his supervisor, {X3}, or to seek legal advice from Wing Lung Bank according to its requirement and by reasonable judgement. {X2} also failed to document the Arrangement in the procedure manual of Wing Lung Bank as required by Wing Lung Bank.\n\n\n\n{X3}, the Assistant General Manager of Wing Lung Bank as well as a responsible officer of Wing Lung Futures, was responsible for supervising {X2} during the relevant time. He did not take sufficient steps to monitor and supervise {X2} to ensure that there was no unlicensed dealing in futures contracts and that {X2} had documented all procedures including the Arrangement in the relevant procedure manual, thereby breaching the Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\nThe practice had been in place since 1996. It ended following the SFC inspection in June 2004.\n\n\n\nThe HKMA finds {X1}, {X2} and{X3} guilty of misconduct. The SFC concludes that {X1}, {X2}, {X3}, and Wing Lung Futures are guilty of misconduct and their fitness and properness has been called into question.\n\n\n\nProsecution and disciplinary action\n\n\n\nThe SFC and the parties involved in the investigation have come to a settlement in relation to the prosecution and disciplinary action, with the concurrence of the HKMA.\n\n\n\nAs part of the settlement, {X1}, {X2} and Wing Lung Futures pleaded guilty on 27 April 2006 to one summons each for unlicensed dealing/aiding and abetting unlicensed dealing before Magistrate Mr Ian Candy at the Eastern Magistracy. {X1}, {X2} and Wing Lung Futures were convicted but absolutely discharged without penalty by Magistrate Candy, who took into account the SFC's severe disciplinary penalties. Wing Lung Futures was ordered to pay the SFC's investigation costs.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considered that, with the concurrence of the HKMA, it is in the public interest and in the interest of the investing public to settle the disciplinary action jointly against Wing Lung Futures, {X1}, {X2} and{X3} according to the following terms:\n\n\t- reprimand and fine Wing Lung Futures $900,000;\n\n\t- suspend {X1}'s licence under the SFO and impose a prohibition order on him against acting as an executive officer of a registered institution or a relevant individual engaged by a registered institution in respect of a regulated activity under the Banking Ordinance for 6 months from 27 April 2006 to 26 October 2006;\n\n\t- impose a prohibition order on {X2} against acting as a licensed person under the SFO, and an executive officer of a registered institution or a relevant individual engaged by a registered institution in respect of a regulated activity under the Banking Ordinance for 8 months from 27 April 2006 to 26 December 2006; and\n\n\t- reprimand {X3}.\n\n\n\nIn determining the penalty, both the SFC and the HKMA have taken into account all the circumstances of the case including the fact that:\n\n\t- The matter was brought to the attention of the SFC by {X2} on behalf of Wing Lung Futures of his own volition during an SFC inspection;\n\n\t- Wing Lung Futures, {X1}, and {X2} were co-operative with the investigation of the SFC by pleading guilty to the SFC's criminal charges of unregistered dealing/aiding and abetting unregistered dealing, and they and{X3} were co-operative by settling the SFC's and the HKMA's disciplinary proceedings;\n\n\t- the failings of Wing Lung Futures, {X1}, {X2}, and{X3} were inadvertent;\n\n\t- the scale of the unregistered dealing was not significant;\n\n\t- there was no apparent improper dealings or loss to any client arising from the Arrangement;\n\n\t- although the unregistered dealing lasted for 8 years, part of it occurred before the implementation of the SFO on 1 April 2003. In this regard, the SFC and the HKMA have considered the penalty prevailing before 1 April 2003 for misconduct of a similar nature;\n\n\t- Wing Lung Futures, Wing Lung Bank, {X1}, {X2} and{X3} have had clean records with the SFC and the HKMA; and\n\n\t- Wing Lung Bank has conducted a detailed internal review and has put in place procedures to prevent this situation from arising again.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: \"The SFC is empowered to punish registered institutions, their staff and management if they are guilty of misconduct or if their fitness and properness is called into question. Registered institutions, their staff and management must understand the requirements under the SFO, the Banking Ordinance as well as other related regulations and guidelines. The SFC expects the same standard from registered institutions as from licensees, and will impose the same punishment for non-compliance of the above legislation. It is also the SFC's policy to hold the management of registered institutions responsible for supervisory failings when appropriate, as it is with licensees\".\n\n\n\nMr. Raymond Li, the Executive Director of the HKMA responsible for the enforcement function, said: \"This is the first time that relevant individuals are jointly disciplined by the SFC and the HKMA under the SFO.

The SFC also had concerns about the sale of geared products (Geared Products) (Note 2).\n\n\n\nPGF 1\n\n\n\nThe SFC investigated complaints from numerous clients of UKFPAHK who invested in PGF 1 and was concerned that UKFPAHK:\n\n\n\ndid not perform adequate due diligence into the Fund;\n\nfailed to have adequate regard to whether PGF 1 was suitable for its clients and sold PGF 1 to clients whose investment objectives and risk tolerance did not always match the risk profiles of the Fund;\n\nfailed to make adequate disclosure of relevant material and information to clients; and\n\nfailed to monitor the Fund’s progress properly, in particular the valuation and unit pricing of the Fund, and to communicate to clients an accurate picture concerning the Fund as events unfolded.\n\n\n\nWithout admission of liability to investors, UKFPAHK has agreed to settle claims made by eligible investors in PGF 1 who invested through UKFPAHK (PGF 1 Investors) on the following basis:\n\n\n\nClaims by PGF 1 Investors who remain invested in the Fund as at the date of this press release will be settled by the payment of an amount which will allow those investors the potential to recover 80% of the amount they originally invested in PGF 1. Investors may recover more if they remain in the Fund until the terms of certain underlying guarantees take effect. The payment offered will take account of the projected value of the Fund, and any PGF 1 Investors whose investment has a projected return equal to or greater than 80% of the amount originally invested will not be entitled to any payment under this scheme. For the avoidance of doubt, any redemption by PGF 1 Investors of their investment on or after the date of this press release will not alter the amount of the payment offered to those investors.\n\n\n\nClaims by PGF 1 Investors who have redeemed their investment before the date of this press release will be settled by the payment of an amount which, when added to the redemption proceeds received by those investors, equals 80% of their original investment. Any PGF 1 Investors who, on redemption of their investment before today, received back an amount equal to or greater than 80% of the amount they originally invested will not be entitled to any payment under this scheme.\n\n\n\nPGF 2\n\n\n\nIn addition to PGF 1, UKFPAHK was also involved in the sale of investments in Circus Capital Protected Growth Fund Series 2 and certain other Circus Capital funds as set out in Note 3 (collectively referred to as PGF 2). UKFPAHK has agreed to settle claims made by eligible investors in PGF 2 who invested through UKFPAHK (PGF 2 Investors) on the same basis as it will settle the claims of PGF 1 Investors. That is to say, claims by eligible PGF 2 Investors will be settled by the payment of an amount (if any) which will allow those investors the potential to recover 80% of the amount they originally invested in PGF 2.\n\n\n\nGeared Products\n\n\n\nAs part of the settlement of the disciplinary proceedings with the SFC and also without admission of liability, UKFPAHK has agreed to settle claims made by eligible investors who invested through UKFPAHK in geared with profits products (Geared Products Investors) on the following basis:\n\n\n\nClaims by Geared Products Investors who still hold their investment as at the date of this press release will be settled by the payment of an amount which will allow those investors the potential to recover 60% of the amount they originally invested in the relevant geared product. Investors may recover more if they retain their investment until maturity when the terms of certain underlying guarantees take effect. The payment offered will take account of the projected value of the geared product, and any Geared Products Investors whose investment has a projected return equal to or greater than 60% of the amount originally invested will not be entitled to any payment under this scheme. For the avoidance of doubt, any redemption by Geared Products Investors of their investment on or after the date of this press release will not alter the amount of the payment offered to those investors.\n\n\n\nClaims by Geared Products Investors who have redeemed their investment before the date of this press release will be settled by the payment of an amount which, when added to the redemption proceeds received by those investors, equals 60% of their original investment. Any Geared Products Investors who, on redemption of their investment before today, received back an amount equal to or greater than 60% of the amount they originally invested will not be entitled to any payment under this scheme.\n\n\n\nClaims by Geared Products Investors who, in addition to their original investment, have paid out money in order to satisfy a margin call will be settled by the payment of an amount calculated in accordance with the above principles which will allow those investors to recover 60% of their total investment, their total investment being their original investment plus the amount paid to satisfy the margin call.\n\n\n\nThe difference in the amounts of the payments to be offered to PGF Investors and Geared Products Investors reflects the different circumstances regarding PGF and Geared Products and the different nature of the products. The concerns of widespread mis-selling of PGF 1 which caused significant damage to investors in PGF 1 who invested via UKFPAHK is compared to the sale of Geared Products, where the products themselves may have been suitable were it not for the gearing. Geared Investors may not have suffered any damage had they not acted upon the gearing advice and as such, not all investors geared their investment following UKFPAHK’s advice. The SFC has received relatively few complaints from UKFPAHK investors in Geared Products, particularly considering the overall number of clients who invested in Geared Products.\n\n\n\nUKFPAHK will establish schemes to administer the above payments which will be administered in Hong Kong and supervised by the SFC.\n\n\n\nEligible PGF Investors and Geared Products Investors will receive a letter from UKFPAHK informing them of the above schemes and asking them to confirm within 60 days of the date of that letter whether they wish to make a claim against UKFPAHK. Letters will be sent to PGF Investors during May, and to Geared Products Investors during June.\n\n\n\nInvestors are advised to consider their circumstances in relation to PGF and Geared Products and to take independent legal and financial advice in relation to UKFPAHK's offer.\n\n\n\nThe SFC welcomes the extensive co-operation it has received from the current management of UKFPAHK who were not involved in the sale of PGF or Geared Products, and acknowledges the responsible approach taken by current management to this issue. As a result of that responsible approach and UKFPAHK's agreement to offer the above payments, the SFC has limited its disciplinary action against UKFPAHK to the issue of a severe reprimand.\n\n\n\nUKFPAHK will keep its Hong Kong office open until 31 December 2006 or until all payments have been made, if earlier. Subject to UKFPAHK having used its reasonable endeavours to complete the schemes by 31 December 2006 then, after that date, UKFPAHK may administer the schemes from the United Kingdom subject to the SFC’s approval and any reasonable conditions that the SFC may impose.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers the above settlement to be in the interests of the investing public and in the public interest. In settling, the SFC has taken into account that:\n\n\n\nthe UKFPAHK schemes amount to substantial mitigation;\n\nthe senior management of UKFPAHK who were responsible for PGF and Geared Products are no longer with UKFPAHK; and\n\nUKFPAHK’s current management (who were not involved in the failings) have co-operated extensively with the SFC.\n\n\n\nMr Alan Linning, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Mis-selling continues to be a problem in the industry. It is vital that investment advisers assess risk profiles of investors and properly advise them about suitable products. It is a primary duty of advisers that the investment recommendations they make are reasonable. We will punish investment advisers who fail to have regard to the suitability of products for their customers.”\n\n\n\n“The SFC considers that this settlement is in the public interest in light of UKFPAHK’s co-operation and the promise of continuing co-operation during the life of the PGF and Geared Products schemes,” he said.\n\n\n\nMr Martin Wheatley, Chairman of the SFC, said: “We wish to remind investors that they also have a duty to consider whether what they are buying is within their risk tolerance and suits their investment objectives. No investment is guaranteed and the regulatory system is not designed to underwrite all investor losses. Even in the event that proper advice has been given, investors must accept the risk of poor performance of a product due to unfavourable market movements or other adverse economic conditions. The SFC cannot order compensation and investors may have to turn to the civil courts for recourse.”\n\n\n\nMrs. Alexa Lam, SFC’s Executive Director of Intermediaries and Investment Products, said: “With a view to further enhancing investor protection and facilitating the development of the investment advisory market in Hong Kong, the SFC works closely with the industry. Where necessary, the SFC will issue further guidance to help market practitioners fulfill the requirements set out in our codes and guidelines, particularly in the area concerning suitability of product recommendations given to investors.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

The Court last night also issued an interim Mareva Injunction against Mr Ip Shu Kun, a licensed representative of Man Lung Hong, and his wife, Ms Chan Sau King, restraining them from removing any of their assets from Hong Kong, or dealing with or diminishing the value of any of their assets within Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nThe administrators\n\n\n\nThe SFC applied for the appointment of administrators under section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance.\n\n\n\nThis action follows a restriction notice that was issued by the SFC against Man Lung Hong on 31 August 2007. The restriction notice prohibited Man Lung Hong from carrying on all activities for which it is licensed, disposing of or dealing with any assets held by it or held on behalf of its clients, and assisting, counselling or procuring another person to dispose of or deal with any such property without prior written consent from the SFC. (Note 1)\n\n\n\nThe administrators have been appointed principally to protect the interests of Man Lung Hong’s clients. The Court has granted the administrators wide powers including the power to investigate Man Lung Hong’s affairs, verify clients’ claims and return client assets.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s decision to issue a restriction notice against Man Lung Hong, and subsequently to make application to the Court to appoint administrators, arose out of an initial investigation of alleged misappropriation of client assets by a licensed representative of Man Lung Hong. During the course of the SFC’s investigation, it has become apparent that:\n\n\n\n(a) securities and money belonging to clients of Man Lung Hong may have been misappropriated;\n\n\n\n(b) falsified statements and contract notes were issued to the clients to conceal the misappropriation; and\n\n\n\n(c) management of the firm may have identified some earlier misappropriation of client assets but this may have been concealed from both clients and the SFC.\n\n\n\nThe shortfall amounts reported by the firm's clients amounted to approximately $25 million as of 1 September 2007.\n\n\n\nIn view of the serious nature of these apparent breaches, the SFC does not consider it to be in the public interest or in the interest of the investing public to permit Man Lung Hong and its management to verify clients’ positions and handle the return of client assets. The SFC considers there to be a need for independent and experienced professional accountants to administer the affairs of the firm, verify clients’ positions and return client assets in a prompt and orderly manner.\n\n\n\nThe SFC has also varied the restriction notice issued on 31 August 2007 today in light of the appointment of the administrators.\n\n\n\nThe order appointing the administrators is an interim order and the matter will come back to the Court for another hearing on 21 September 2007, at which time Man Lung Hong will have the opportunity to oppose the continuation of the order and to present evidence and arguments.\n\n\n\nThe administrators will send a circular to Man Lung Hong’s clients shortly to explain the circumstances of the firm and to request them to submit their claims.\n\n\n\nClients may contact the administrators on their hotline: (852) 3121 9888 during office hours (8.30am – 7pm, Monday to Friday).\n\n\n\nMareva Injunction\n\n\n\nThe interim Mareva Injunction was obtained in the High Court, also under section 213 of the SFO, in an effort to safeguard and protect the interests of Man Lung Hong’s clients.\n\n\n\nThe interim Injunction will remain in force until 7 September 2007 when the matter will be reconsidered by the Court.\n\n\n\nSFC’s inquiries into the conduct of Man Lung Hong and its management will continue. Further announcements will be made when appropriate.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

His purpose was to give the market the false impression that the three securities were in hot demand. The artificial buy orders had inflated the existing demand by over 100% in one stock and by more than 450% in another. As soon as he completed his sell orders, he cancelled the artificial buy orders.\n\n\n\nChan pleaded guilty today before Mr Wahab Abu Baker bin, a Magistrate at Eastern Magistracy, to each of the three charges. In addition to the suspended imprisonment sentence and fine, Chan was ordered to pay the SFC’s investigation costs of $16,650.\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Falsifying demand is blatant manipulation.

Mr Choi Tsz Ming and Ms Fung Yuen Kwan, former clerks, were each jailed for 14 months.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, the SFC uncovered in its inspection of Lawsons a case of assets belonging to Lawsons’ clients having been misappropriated and reported the case to the Commercial Crime Bureau.\n\n\n\nThe SFC continues its rigorous supervision of brokerage firms and will take appropriate action against those who have abused the trust of their clients.\n\n\n\nCircularisation\n\n\n\nThe Lawsons case demonstrates the importance and benefit of independent circularisation procedures as the misconduct was uncovered by a special circularisation exercise required by the SFC during its inspection of Lawsons.\n\n\n\nIndependent circularisation by the auditor, as a special exercise or as part of the year-end audit, can be a valuable service for investors. Circularisation is an effective tool for detecting unauthorised trading and misappropriation and the provision of account details by a party independent of the broker provides investors with the opportunity to check their stockholding and account balances against the broker's record.\n\nHowever, clients often ignore audit confirmation requests by auditors or fail to sign the confirmation correctly when returning them. In doing so they are not taking advantage of the additional assurance that this exercise can provide regarding the integrity of their account.\n\n\n\nThe SFC emphasises that it is in the client's interest to reply to audit confirmation properly and promptly.

The SFC has also reprimanded Upbest Investment for failing to maintain the required level of liquid capital and failing to notify the SFC of its liquid capital deficiencies. The reprimand was withheld until today as the SFC awaited the determination of the SFAT.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Choy, the financial controller of the Upbest Group, Cheng, a director of the Upbest Group and Upbest Investment and Li, also a director of Upbest Group and Upbest Securities were all involved in a scheme to inflate the liquidity position of Upbest Securities and Upbest Investments by using inter-company cheques. Unpresented cheques were treated as cash when calculating the required liquidity level. This scheme had the consequence that the SFC was misled as to the real state of liquidity of those firms.\n\n\n\nThe suspensions were reviewed by the SFAT which rejected an argument that these defaults were merely technical. The SFAT was satisfied that this was “…a thoroughly disingenuous and commercially self-serving scheme which had the practical effect of positively misleading the regulator…” (Note 5).\n\n\n\nAlthough the SFAT upheld the SFC’s reasoning, the SFAT varied the periods of suspension reducing Choy’s suspension from nine months to six months; Cheng’s suspension from six months to four months and Li’s suspension from four months to three months (Note 6).\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “Intermediaries must be wholly accurate in the financial returns filed with the SFC.

The warning letters related to breaches that occurred in May 2003 and in November 2003, one month prior to the breaches in this case.\n\n\n\nIn dismissing the application by Christfund and Cheung, the SFAT said “this Tribunal takes the view that the FRR represent significant statutory safeguards for the interests of investors in the market, and it should not be thought that any argument mounted along the lines of mere “technical” default is in principle likely to be sympathetically received. In short, the FRR are in position for very good reason and their requirements are flouted or ignored or overlooked at the peril of the defaulter, who should be in no doubt but that in the view of this Tribunal the regulator rightly regards, and rightly chooses to enforce, such Rules as embodying important safeguards within the proper functioning of the Hong Kong market”.\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “The Financial Resources Rules are an important prudential safeguard protecting the interests of the investing public.

Yick also failed to disclose the transaction to shareholders and to the market despite being required to do so under the GEM Listing Rules.\n\n\n\nThe third party defaulted on the loan and Riverhill lost the entire $10 million reducing its net asset value by more than 20%.\n\n\n\nThe SFC also alleged similar breaches in relation to unsecured loans totalling about $25 million authorised by Yick to employees of Riverhill and other third parties. Although these loans were ultimately repaid, Yick failed to exercise proper care and skill. Again these loans were not disclosed to shareholders as required under the GEM Listing Rules.\n\n\n\nThe SFC was also concerned that the moneys loaned to the employees were used to open accounts with brokers through which Yick then directed trading in securities for Riverhill.\n\n\n\nAs Yick agreed to a summary of facts, the matter was dealt with by the Court today without the need for a full trial.\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “This is the first time a listed company director has been disqualified for misconduct under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Yick’s failure to act in the best interests of Riverhill and to properly inform the market represents serious misconduct. Today’s Court decision should send a positive message to investors that listed company directors are required to place the interests of the company and its shareholders first – not last.”\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1. Yick is an accountant. In addition to being an executive director of Riverhill, he was also the Chief Financial Officer. He resigned as a director of Riverhill on 23 July 2003. Riverhill was incorporated in 2000 under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The company was engaged in the provision of technology related services.\n\n\n\n2.

Huffy Corporation, a US-based corporation, was engaged in the manufacturing and trading of golf equipment, bags and accessories. Huffy was one of the top five customers of Sino Golf Manufacturing Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sino Golf. On 20 October 2004, Huffy filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and notified Sino Golf on 21 October 2004. Although Huffy’s bankruptcy was publicly known in the US, there was no publicly known connection between Huffy and Sino Golf that would have enabled the market to know or appreciate that Huffy’s bankruptcy would have any effect on Sino Golf.\n\n3. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US is an attempt by a company to stay in business while a bankruptcy court supervises the reorganisation of the company’s contractual and debt obligations. The court can grant complete or partial relief from most of the company’s debts and contracts and obligations so that the company can make a fresh start of business. Upon the filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, creditors are not allowed to attempt to collect previously incurred debts owed to others by the company except through the bankruptcy court.\n\n4.

In a hearing late this afternoon, the Court of Appeal rejected that application.\n\n\n\nSuspension Arrangements\n\n\n\nThe interim order means, as from 4.00 am tomorrow (Wednesday) and until 15 July 2008, Hong Kong Forex will be unable:\n\n\n\n- to conduct any leveraged foreign exchange business for new clients; or\n\n- to accept and execute new orders from existing clients.\n\n\n\nThe SFC and Hong Kong Forex have discussed arrangements for the management of the suspension of its licensed activities including arrangements that will ensure existing clients with outstanding positions will not be prejudiced. The arrangements include:\n\n\n\n- the continuation of Hong Kong Forex’s licensed activities for 60 days to ensure client money is returned and clients’ positions can be closed in an orderly fashion;\n\n- communication with staff, clients and the general public; and\n\n- ongoing monitoring by and communication with the SFC.\n\n\n\nClients who wish to find out more details can contact Hong Kong Forex on the following hotlines: 3180 8911, 3180 8912, 3180 8913, 3180 8914 or 3180 8915.\n\n\n\nEnds\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

The SFC found that:\n\nChuang had no formal role or responsibility within Chung Nam in relation to client securities or settlement responsibilities and yet he was allowed to initiate the process of withdrawing $30 million in client securities;\n\nChuang said he acted on the basis of instructions given to him by a person (unauthorised by the client) in a telephone call made to an unoccupied desk which he had answered;\n\nChuang handed the $30 million in securities over to another person (also unauthorised by the client) who went to Chung Nam’s offices to take delivery of the securities purportedly on behalf of the client;\n\nneither Chung Nam nor Chuang had any authorisation from Chung Nam’s client who was the beneficial owner of the $30 million in securities to withdraw those securities or to deliver them to the unauthorised person; and\n\nChung Nam failed to verify the identity or authority of the unauthorised persons on whose instructions Chuang was acting and to whom the client’s securities were delivered and Chung Nam’s procedures did not require any such verification.\n\n\n\nThe SFC concluded that Chung Nam had failed to institute proper or sufficient systems to safeguard client assets and failed to establish an effective procedure for ensuring client securities are protected from misappropriation. The SFC did not find Chuang or Chung Nam dishonest in relation to the misappropriation of the $30 million in securities nor that they received or were trying to receive any benefit from the misappropriation (in fact the $30 million in securities were recovered without the beneficial owner suffering any loss).

This would have given the impression to other investors that the warrants were actively traded.\n\n\n\nGrand Investment was effectively charging its clients brokerage commission as low as 0.04% when the commission rebate offered by Macquarie Bank for trading the relevant derivative warrants could run as high as 0.25% of the transaction value. As a result, two of Grand Investment’s clients were able to generate risk-free profit by buying and selling the same derivative warrant at the same price and at almost the same time (Note 4).\n\n\n\nGrand Investment did not take any action to prevent and stop its clients from trading in the abusive manner. In addition, the company’s brokerage commission arrangement with the two clients made it appear that the brokerage commission paid by the two clients was 0.25% instead of the actual 0.04%. As a result, Macquarie Bank paid the two clients more commission rebate than the brokerage commission Grand Investment actually charged them.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Grand Investment’s conduct was not in the interests of market integrity and was prejudicial to the investing public because the clients’ abusive trading would inevitably create a false appearance that the relevant derivative warrants were actively traded.\n\n\n\nThe SFC also found that Lee and Chung had failed to properly and actively participate in Grand Investment’s business, and their failures contributed to the breaches and failures of Grand Investment.\n\n\n\n“The SFC will continue to crack down on brokers whose conduct facilitates abusive trading by clients,” the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n1.

In entering into this agreement, SCB does not accept that it has done anything wrong and is making the payments voluntarily.\n\n\n\nUnder the payment scheme, about 1,260 SCB clients who invested in the relevant funds will each be eligible to receive a total payment ranging between US$0.1 and US$12,739 plus interest, making a total amount available under the scheme of about US$320,000 plus interest (Note 4).\n\n\n\nThe SFC acknowledges the valuable assistance of the HKMA which conducted the investigation into SCB’s conduct.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said: “Fair treatment to clients means not giving advantages to one client at the expense of others. This is an important obligation under the SFC’s Code of Conduct. The bank has demonstrated its commitment to this important obligation by entering into this agreement. This is a good result for the bank, its clients as well as the regulators.”\n\n\n\nThe HKMA’s Executive Director of Banking Development, Mr Raymond Li, agreed: “This is indeed a good result for all parties concerned. The HKMA will continue to co-operate closely with the SFC on enforcement matters in relation to registered institutions.”\n\n\n\nIn deciding on the appropriate action to take against and the resolution with SCB, the SFC took into account the mitigating factors that SCB self reported the matter to the HKMA and co-operated fully with both the HKMA and the SFC in agreeing to make these payments to clients.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Under the rebate arrangement, Macquarie agreed to reimburse investors, through their participating brokers, either in full or in part, the brokerage costs they were charged by their brokers for trading specified warrants.\n\n\n\nIn January 2002, the SFC warned Macquarie that they should ensure their commission rebate scheme did not facilitate trading of MB warrants that was not for any genuine economic or commercial purpose. The SFC was concerned that the commission rebate scheme could encourage improper trading and lead to a false market for the MB warrants.\n\n\n\nThe SFC identified heavy trading activities in MB warrants between two clients from two participating brokerages during the period from January 2004 to January 2005. The two clients repeatedly traded the MB warrants at or near the same prices within short time intervals and created substantial amounts of turnover (Note 3). While generating a significant amount of commission rebate from Macquarie, the two brokerages gave the clients discounts on brokerage costs for large volume trading. The two clients were then able to generate risk-free profit from the difference between the commission rebate and the discounted brokerage costs (Note 4).\n\n\n\nMacquarie had put in place some controls to deal with the risk to market integrity and monitored the payment of commission rebate. However Macquarie failed to check whether the commission rebate scheme was providing clients with more money than was required to rebate actual brokerage costs. The volume and nature of the trading should have alerted Macquarie to make additional inquiries about the operation of the commission rebate scheme and to check whether it was distorting the market for these MB warrants.\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers that if Macquarie had realised the true nature of this trading activity, Macquarie would have been obliged to ban those brokers from further participation in the commission rebate scheme. Macquarie eventually did ban some commission rebate scheme participants, but this was too late (Note 5).\n\n\n\nMacquarie’s failure to properly monitor the operation of its commission rebate scheme contributed to conditions which created a distorted market for the relevant MB warrants for more than a year. The trading may have misled investors that certain MB warrants were more actively traded by a wider range of investors than was actually the case.\n\n\n\n“Licensed intermediaries, especially those entrusted with the function of providing liquidity in a derivative warrant market, have an obligation to help protect market integrity,” the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said.\n\n\n\n“Intermediaries should be alert to identify obviously suspicious trading especially when put on notice by the regulator and we will take action where intermediaries fail to maintain the standards of diligence expected in Hong Kong,” he added.\n\n\n\nIn deciding on the public reprimand and a fine of HK$4 million, the SFC has taken into account that Macquarie took some steps to supervise its commission rebate scheme, it was not itself a party effecting any abusive trading, it has co-operated with the SFC in the disciplinary proceedings and its clean disciplinary record.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Macquarie Equities (Asia) Ltd is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities) regulated activities.\n\n2. The SFC banned commission rebate schemes in March 2006.\n\n3. For example, in one particular warrant, on one day, two clients of two participating brokers engaged in about 400 trades between themselves in just over 60 minutes of trading with a transaction around every 10 seconds (being responsible for 90% of turnover on that day). The trades were conducted at or near the same prices within short time intervals and with effective brokerage commission costs below the amount of commission rebate paid by Macquarie. It appears the trading turnover of the relevant MB warrants was inflated and may have misled investors into believing that certain MB warrants were more actively traded than was actually the case.\n\n4. The SFC has commenced criminal proceedings against Patrick Fu Kor Kuen and Francis Lee Shu Yuen, clients of two brokers claiming commission rebates, for manipulative trading in MB warrants. They were charged under section 295 of the SFO for creating a false and misleading appearance of active trading in a number of MB warrants between January 2004 and January 2005 (see SFC press release dated 6 November 2008).\n\n5.

The regulator carefully considered the whole case, including its extensive history, and in the exercise of its discretion came to a decision with which this Tribunal emphatically declines to interfere upon this application.”\n\n\n\nThe SFAT also confirmed the SFC’s decision to ban Hong Kong Forex’s major shareholder, Tse Shiu Hoi, from re-entering the industry for life and to prohibit Eddie Ng Chit Chung, Hong Kong Forex’s former responsible officer, from becoming licensed or registered for a period of three years.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s decision was based on the findings that there had been a complete failure of compliance systems and controls within Hong Kong Forex especially in relation to unlicensed activities and cold calling. The SFC contended that Hong Kong Forex and its senior management facilitated, encouraged and turned a blind eye to continuing misconduct for the benefit of Tse (Note 2).\n\n\n\nThe Honourable Mr Justice Stone agreed and said in his determination that Hong Kong Forex “continued to embody a culture which is (or was) rotten to the core…”\n\n\n\n“This was a bad case.

In almost all of the cases, the Sincere Bullion staff paired up with Hong Kong Forex’s licensed staff and funnelled leveraged foreign exchange trades to Hong Kong Forex or Tse’s International Investment (Macau) Ltd, a related Macau company controlled by Hong Kong Forex’s substantial shareholder, Tse Shiu Hoi. Tse’s International Investment (Macau) was not licensed in Hong Kong, nor was it permitted to carry on leveraged foreign exchange trading in Macau under Macau law.

The SFC found that, over a period of three days in April 2005, Chu and Wong used a “scaffolding” strategy in trading three stocks to facilitate their disposal of the relevant stocks at a more favourable price level (Note 4).\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that shortly after Chu and Wong had placed a sell order, they would repeatedly place, cancel and re-input numerous buy orders which substantially inflated the apparent demand of the relevant stocks. They then cancelled all or most of the outstanding buy orders as soon as their sell orders were fully executed.\n\n\n\nThe SFC held that Chu and Wong placed the buy orders for the purpose of creating a false and misleading impression about the supply and demand of the stocks.\n\n\n\nThe SFC therefore concluded that Chu and Wong were not fit and proper persons as their trading activities had damaged the integrity of the market, and decided to suspend Chu’s licence. Chu appealed to the SFAT.\n\n\n\nOn 30 June 2010, the SFAT affirmed the SFC’s decision to suspend Chu’s licence (Note 5).\n\n\n\nIn this important ruling, the SFAT confirmed that when market trading activities are being evaluated in disciplinary proceedings, it is not necessary to prove a criminal offence or a contravention of the market misconduct provisions under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT made it clear that: “conduct that may properly be described as trading that is not genuine must, plainly, constitute misconduct. Equally it must plainly constitute conduct that a person who is fit and proper to remain regulated, would not carry out. False trading could never be described as an honest or fair act, or in the best interests of the market. We accept the submission of the SFC that if false trading is established, the persons engaging in such trading will be liable to disciplinary action for misconduct…” (Note 6).\n\n\n\nThe SFAT reduced the suspension period imposed by the SFC from three years to 18 months taking into account similar cases that took place at around the same time as the conduct in this case. However, the SFAT also observed that it is “…right that a more serious view is now taken by the SFC of the conduct under question…” (Note 7).\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\t- Chu is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities and accredited to SBI E2-Capital Securities Ltd, SBI E2-Capital Commodities Ltd and SBI E2-Financial Services Ltd.\n\n\t- The SFAT’s reasons for determination is available on its website at www.sfat.gov.hk.\n\n\t- Please see SFC press release dated 25 February 2009 for the SFC’s disciplinary action against Wong.\n\n\t- “Scaffolding”, the English translation of the Chinese term “搭棚”, is a form of market manipulation.

This type of pricing mechanism is common in the Japanese market and usually the offering price determination day is the first day of the selected range which was 19 July 2006 in this case.\n\n\n\nThe SFC alleged that Oasis entered a series of orders for JAL shares in the last 15 minutes before the market closed on 19 July 2006, including:\n\n\n\nmarket-on-close buy orders and cancelling them subsequently; and\n\na large volume of short sell orders during the last five minutes before market closed on the TSE. Some of the short sell orders were incorrectly labelled as short sell exempt orders, such that the Funds were able to enter sell orders at prices lower than the latest executed prices (Note 2 & 3).\n\n\n\nOn the settlement day for the short sell orders, Oasis failed to deliver shares in nearly 70% of the shares they had short sold with approximately 50% of these transactions having to be covered by new shares issued by JAL in the public offer.\n\n\n\nThe SFC alleged that Oasis’ trading strategy, which originated in Hong Kong and was executed by Fischer, appeared to have been designed to drive down the closing price of JAL on 19 July 2006 to the detriment of the market for JAL shares. The SFC also alleged a lower closing price would benefit the Funds as subscribers for the new shares. In light of these matters, the SFC held concerns as to the fitness and properness of Oasis and Fischer.\n\n\n\nOasis and Fischer do not admit their strategy was designed to mislead the market for JAL shares. However, they have agreed to accept these sanctions which the SFC regards as a sufficient expiation for the SFC’s concerns about their conduct on 19 July 2006.\n\n\n\nThe SFC has taken into account that Oasis and Fischer have clean disciplinary records and have co-operated with the SFC. The SFC has also taken into account that Oasis and Fischer voluntarily took steps, in 2007, not required by law or regulation, to reduce any similar concerns arising again from their trading by imposing internal guidelines in relation to all secondary offerings on the TSE against entering any sell order for a stock in the afternoon session that is lower than the morning closing price for any day of the publicly disclosed pricing period and against any sell orders in the last 15 minutes of trading for any day of the publicly disclosed pricing period.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward said, “The high fines underscore the SFC’s determination to ensure Hong Kong’s market remains an international and regional hub for high standards. These sanctions together with the voluntary steps undertaken by Oasis and Mr Fischer are an appropriate expiation for the SFC’s concerns as to fitness and properness.”\n\n\n\nThe SFC wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the Japanese Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission which referred the matter to the SFC.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Citi Asia will also pay for an external expert to conduct a review of the internal and external detection, escalation and notification practices and policies in Citi Asia’s private banking division in relation to compliance with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements in its securities business, including:\n\n\n\nthe identification and handling of red flags by all staff involved in regulated activities; and\n\nperformance management of all staff engaged in supervision of staff conducting regulated activities, including calculation of compensation in respect to supervisory functions.\n\n\n\nCiti Asia will implement all recommendations by the external expert and submit to a surprise audit of all detection, escalation, notification, red flag practices and policies at a time to be selected by the SFC within two years of today’s date.\n\n\n\n “Citi Asia not only failed to detect a Ponzi scheme operating under its nose, despite having the opportunity to do so, but then failed to report the scheme to the SFC in a timely way, thus making the investigation of this case more difficult given Mr X’s decision to leave Hong Kong after he had been dismissed by Citi Asia, ” the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward said.\n\n\n\n“Intermediaries know they have a duty to report misconduct to the SFC immediately upon discovery, not when they have plumbed the bottom of it. Delay in reporting simply helps the wrongdoer. This public reprimand should make it clear that the SFC condemns such delay in the strongest terms,” Mr Steward added.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes :\n\n1. Citi Asia is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO ) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regulated activities.\n\n2. Chan is licensed under the SFO to carry on Type 1 (Dealing in Securities) and Type 2 (Dealing in Futures Contracts) regulated activities. Chan’s licence was accredited to Citi Asia from 1 December 1998 to 14 June 2011. Chan was also a responsible officer of Citi Asia from 31 May 2005 to 14 June 2011.\n\n3. Mr X was licensed under the SFO to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities and was accredited with Citi Asia until he was dismissed by Citi on 16 February 2009. He was employed by Citi Asia’s private banking division at the time of the conduct in question.\n\n4. It appears Mr X promised the affected customers that their principal was protected and returns were guaranteed. Instead, returns were funded wholly or partly from other affected clients induced by Mr X’s representations. In effect, Mr X appears to have been operating a Ponzi or Madoff-style scheme in which high returns are paid to investors out of the contribution by new investors. Ponzi Scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk.\n\n5. Under paragraph 12.5 of the Code of Conduct, a licensed or registered person is required to notify the SFC immediately on the happening of any material breach, infringement, non-compliance with any rules, law, regulations and codes administered or issued by the SFC by itself or persons it employs to conduct business with clients giving particulars of the breach etc and relevant information and documents.\n\n6. For example, Mr X issued correspondence under Citi Asia’s name referring to guaranteed returns contrary to Citi Asia’s internal guidelines. Some of this correspondence was brought to Chan’s attention but Chan accepted Mr X’s explanations and did not conduct any probative inquiry into the true nature of Mr X’s dealings on behalf of Citi Asia’s clients. The reference to guaranteed returns in Mr X’s correspondence was a very clear red flag. A quick check to verify the existence of the US Treasuries and other products supporting Citi Asia’s clients’ investments should have been conducted.","known_entities":"Chan Sin Man Lisa|Citigroup Global Markets Asia Limited|Lisa Chan|Lisa Sin Man Chan|Sin Man Chan|Citigroup Global Markets Asia Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has filed its Statement of Claim in its proceedings against Hontex International Holdings Company Limited (Hontex) following orders made by the Court of First Instance on 22 July 2011 (Note 1).\n\n\n\nIn the Statement of Claim, the SFC alleges that, on 14 December 2009, Hontex issued and distributed a prospectus which contained a number of material overstatements.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the SFC alleges the prospectus materially overstated turnover of the Hontex Group for the years ended 31 December 2006, 2007 and 2008 which the SFC alleges was overstated by approximately RMB 380,934,125, RMB 708,894,820 and RMB 974,733,321 respectively; profit before tax of the Group which the SFC alleges was overstated in respect of the same financial years by approximately RMB 102,935,289 RMB 185,001,887 and RMB 298,286,785 respectively as well as the value of cash and cash equivalent balances and the number of franchise stores (Note 2) .\n\n\n\nThe SFC is seeking a number of orders, under section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), including injunctions and orders requiring Hontex to take steps to effect a return of subscribed capital to the public shareholders of the company.\n\n\n\nThe Court has made interim orders freezing up to $997.4 million held by Hontex and its four subsidiaries following an urgent application by the SFC on 29 March 2010.

The issue of jurisdiction arises because of the Hon Mr Justice Harris’ decision in the case against Tiger Asia Management LLC (Tiger Asia).\n\n\n\nLast Wednesday, the Hon Mr Justice Harris of the Court of First Instance refused to grant such leave in this case. The SFC will seek leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the Hon Mr Justice Harris’ decision given the importance of the issue. The SFC will apply for any such appeal, if one be permitted by the Court of Appeal, to be consolidated with the SFC’s appeal in the Tiger Asia case (Note 4).\n\n\n\nThe SFC considers there is a strong need to clarify the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance in section 213 cases generally and, in this case, before the parties are obliged to expend significant resources in preparation for the scheduled trial in 2012.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

The proceedings were commenced under section 213 of the SFO. The SFC made the original application on 29 March 2010 and obtained an interim injunction ex parte on the same day. Earlier this year, the SFC sought final orders in its proceedings. However, the Court considered the SFC should file a Statement of Claim so that the SFC’s allegations are set out in formal pleadings. Hontex is required to file a defence to the allegations within 56 days.\n\n2. The SFC alleges that Hontex has contravened section 298 and section 300 of the SFO and/or section 342F of the Companies Ordinance (CO) and/or section 384 of the SFO. Section 298 of the SFO prohibits the distribution of materially false or misleading information that is likely to induce another person to subscribe or buy securities if the person knows or is reckless as to whether the information is false or misleading. Section 298 is a market misconduct provision. Section 300 of the SFO prohibits the fraudulent conduct or the use of any device or scheme with an intention to deceive. Section 384 of the SFO prohibits false or misleading information being given to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the SFC in compliance with a legal requirement. Section 342F of the CO prohibits untrue statements in prospectuses.\n\n3. The Court of First Instance made interim orders in this proceeding freezing up to $997.4 million held by Hontex and its four subsidiaries following an urgent application by the SFC on 29 March 2010.\n\n4. On 21 June 2011, the Court of First Instance ruled, in proceedings against Tiger Asia and three of its officers, that the Court did not have jurisdiction under s 213 of the SFO to determine a contravention of the market misconduct provisions found in both Parts XIII and XIV of the SFO without the matters having been determined in a criminal court or the Market Misconduct Tribunal first. The Court subsequently struck out the SFC’s case.

Afterwards, CPYC continued to act as Tungda’s continuing sponsor until October 2003 (Note 3).\n\n\n\nShortly after Tungda’s listing, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the Exchange) issued inquiry letters to CPYC in 2003 seeking a response to a complaint that Tungda had falsified invoices and overstated sales figures in its IPO prospectus. CPYC, as continuing sponsor of Tungda, was required to examine its due diligence work, in particular, the basis for the sales claimed by Tungda in the prospectus so as to give the Exchange a proper response.\n\n\n\nThe SFC alleged that CPYC’s response, contained in three submissions, was prepared under the supervision of Wan and was both misleading and inaccurate giving the unjustified impression that CPYC had conducted sufficient due diligence when in fact the verification conducted by CPYC was severely limited and deficient.\n\n\n\nWan on the other hand claimed that he had not been responsible for the due diligence work conducted by CPYC into Tungda and that he had signed the submissions given to the Exchange in a purely administrative capacity. He argued that he was entitled to rely upon the work of others within CPYC; that CPYC had no ongoing obligation to make any inquiry in responding to the Exchange and that CPYC could not have been expected to have detected fraud within Tungda given the auditors had not done so and responsible executives of Tungda were only charged with related criminal offences by the Police’s Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB) in 2010.\n\n\n\nDuring the SFC’s investigation Wan, with the assistance of Yan, also produced to the SFC a substantial volume of documents which purported to be CPYC records and, if genuine, would tend to demonstrate that Wan was neither involved nor responsible for CPYC’s due diligence work on Tungda.\n\n\n\nThe SFC alleged these documents were not genuine CPYC records and had been fabricated to throw the SFC off the track.\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the SFAT, Hon Mr Justice Saunders, agreed with the SFC’s findings and found specifically that:\n\n\n\nIt is untenable for Wan to claim that his signature on the submissions to the Exchange was merely administrative and he was not involved in the due diligence of Tungda;\n\nCPYC and Wan was under a continuing obligation to make inquiries in response to the Exchange’s inquiry;\n\nThe fact that Tungda’s auditor had not uncovered any fraud at Tungda and no criminal charges against Tungda executives were laid until 2010 is irrelevant and does not mean Wan is not responsible for CPYC’s failure to conduct proper inquiries especially in the face of allegations that there had been falsification of sales;\n\nTo distance himself from CPYC’s due diligence of Tungda, Wan was responsible for undertaking an extensive fabrication exercise with the assistance of Yan (Note 4).\n\n\n\nThe Hon Mr Justice Saunders stated in his decision that “…had Mr Wan carried out a proper inquiry and properly responded to the Exchange, the Exchange would have been informed in July 2003 that Tungda were unable to substantiate the overseas sales they had claimed in their prospectus. From that the Exchange would have been able to take such steps as they considered appropriate in pursuit of the complaint of forgery. Instead Mr Wan muddied the waters and concealed the truth” (Note 5).\n\n\n\nMr Mark Steward, the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said: “During the investigation, the SFC cast a cold eye on Wan’s claims and they turned out to be fabricated. Sponsors have an obligation to cast the same cold eye on claims that do not make sense when conducting due diligence inquiries.”\n\n\n\n“This decision makes it clear that sponsors have an important role to play in helping to protect the investing public and their obligations must be performed to a very high standard. Sponsors and their senior staff will be held accountable for negligent, cavalier or dishonest conduct,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe SFAT directed the SFC to refer the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions for him to consider whether any further action may need to be taken.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Wong, Lee and Chik were former executive directors of EHL.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s allegations concern the following:\n\n\n\na) An independent review by KPMG of certain EHL receivables revealed that the recoverability of those receivables (doubtful receivables) amounting to about $2.55 billion as at September 2007 appeared doubtful. These receivables consisted of trade debts, payments under promissory notes and other prepayments for investments. The doubtful receivables were owed by eight debtor corporations (doubtful debtors). EHL eventually made full impairment provisions for the doubtful receivables as losses totalling $2.6 billion.\n\n\n\nb) SFC’s investigation revealed that the directors and/or controllers of at least seven of the doubtful debtors were nominee directors and/or bank signatories appointed by Wong and acted under the instructions of Wong.\n\n\n\nc) After the doubtful debtors received payments from the EHL group purportedly under the promissory notes and investment agreements, they immediately transferred the money to other doubtful debtors and other companies or people under the control of or related to Wong. Substantial parts of the money were eventually routed back to the EHL group on the same day and appear to be round-robin transactions. Other parts of the funds were eventually transferred to companies connected to Wong.\n\n\n\nd) In all, the fund flows connected to the doubtful receivables did not appear to be consistent with their purposes recorded in the books and records of EHL and the related underlying transactions appeared to be bogus.\n\n\n\ne) Wong, Lee and Chik approved the transactions and signed the cheques giving rise to the doubtful receivables. The SFC alleges that they failed to carry out proper inquiry and perform appropriate due diligence before causing or permitting the group to enter into the transactions and parting with substantial sums of money. The SFC further alleges that, as a result, they caused or permitted the misapplication or misuse of EHL’s funds, and exposed the group to unnecessary and unreasonable risk of losses.\n\n\n\nThe SFC contends that EHL’s losses arising from the doubtful receivables were caused by the three former directors’ breaches of:\n\n\n\ntheir fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of the group, and to avoid conflicts of interest\n\nbreaches of the duty of care under common law to exercise due and reasonable skill, care and diligence\n\nrules 3.08 and 3.09 of the Listing Rules of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.\n\n\n\nA summary of the SFC’s petition can be found on the SFC website (www.sfc.hk).\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

The court may also order a company to bring proceedings in its own name against any person specified in the order, or make any order the court considers appropriate.\n\n3.

He had pleaded not guilty to the two charges.

Wong was one of the two responsible officers and sponsor principals in charge of the supervision of Mega Capital’s transaction team on Hontex’s listing application (Notes 2, 3 and 4).\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation found that Wong failed to discharge his duties as a sponsor principal and a responsible officer. The SFC’s main findings are as follows:\r\n\n1.     Supervisory failures\r\n\nWong has failed to properly and adequately supervise the transaction team. Although Wong was in a position to review the work of the transaction team and oversee the progress of the listing through emails that were copied to him, he admitted that he did not read most of the emails relating to Hontex’s listing application.\r\n\nFurthermore, Wong did not fully assess the quality and adequacy of the due diligence inquiries performed by the transaction team. Wong did not review the due diligence questionnaires completed by the transaction team with Hontex’s major customers and suppliers. Consequently, Wong did not realise that material information (like transaction figures with Hontex) was missing from most of the questionnaires and failed to instruct the transaction team to follow up on the missing information.\r\n\n2.     Breach of sponsor's undertaking and filing untrue declaration with SEHK \r\n\nAs one of the sponsor principals for Hontex’s listing application, Wong and another sponsor principal Mr Hong Hui Lung, jointly signed and submitted the sponsor’s undertaking and declaration to SEHK respectively, confirming that Mega Capital would/had made reasonable due diligence inquiries and all information provided to the SEHK was true in all material respects and did not omit any material information. However, Wong did not take adequate step to check whether the transaction team had conducted due diligence properly or at all (Note 5).\r\n\n3.     Refusal to accept responsibilities \r\n\nWong claimed that he only took a secondary role in Hontex’s listing and the principal officer of Mega Capital in charge of Hontex’s listing was Hong, another responsible officer and sponsor principal.\r\n\nWong also claimed that he should not be held responsible for Mega Capital’s sponsor failures because he had not been involved in drafting the prospectus or the due diligence inquiries performed by the transaction team; his major involvement in Hontex’s listing was limited to providing technical advice to the transaction team, such as providing technical guidance on the direction and sufficiency of the answers provided by Mega Capital in response to SEHK’s queries.\r\n\nWong failed to understand that he could not seek to limit his responsibility to the matters that he involved himself in or shift his responsibility to another sponsor principal. Both Wong and Hong should be jointly and severally liable in discharging their roles as sponsor principals (Note 6).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Wong was licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities and was accredited with Mega Capital until 2 May 2012.

They opened accounts with President Securities before they purchased the products, but the account opening process was handled by President Securities Corporation.\r\n\n\t- President Securities staff signed as witnesses on the Taiwanese clients’ account opening documents when, in fact, they had never met the clients.\r\n\n\t- No one from President Securities contacted the Taiwanese clients to verify their identities, explain the account opening documents to them, establish their financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives, and make risk disclosure to them.\r\n\n\t- President Securities did not sufficiently ensure that the Taiwanese clients understood the products and accepted the risks associated with them before accepting their subscriptions for the products. It relied on standard risk disclaimers signed by the Taiwanese clients even though no explanation of the disclaimers had been given to the clients.\r\n\n\t- A number of the products prescribed minimum subscription requirements to restrict the categories of investors eligible to invest in them. Since some of the Taiwanese clients’ subscriptions amounts did not meet the minimum subscription requirements, President Securities pooled their orders together so as to meet the minimum subscription requirements. However, President Securities did not inform such clients that their orders would be pooled together.\r\n\nIn view of these concerns, President Securities has failed to comply with the regulatory standards in relation to opening client accounts for the Taiwanese clients. Its unquestioning acceptance of the Taiwanese clients’ subscriptions for the products and its pooling of client orders that did not meet the minimum subscription requirements reflect that it has failed to act in the best interests of its clients.

HAECO publicly announced the deal on 7 June 2010.\n\n\n\nFollowing the telephone call, Lam walked to his friend’s office in Admiralty from the Hong Kong Club in Central where he had lunch and, through an internet account, purchased the 4,000 shares shortly before trading closed at 4:00 pm.\n\n\n\nHe did not have enough cash in his securities account and paid for the shares by electronically drawing down and transferring $340,000 from an overdraft account. He sold the shares shortly after the deal was announced making a profit of approximately $80,000. He subsequently donated his profits to charity (Note 3).\n\n\n\nLam, who pleaded not guilty at trial, claimed that at the time he purchased the shares, he had forgotten he was an independent non-executive director of HAECO; he was intoxicated and that he did not intend to profit from his trading and so he was entitled to rely upon the statutory defence (Note 4 and 5). Deputy Magistrate Mr John Glass rejected Lam’s claims.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Director of Enforcement of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Mr Mark Steward said: “This was a simple case of insider trading by a true company insider taking a cynical and illegal advantage of his insider status at the expense of other investors.

The pair is alleged to have received financial benefits totalling $79 million and $6.95 million respectively.\n\n\n\nThese transactions, which were not properly disclosed or approved by Styland and its shareholders as required, caused loss and damage to the company and its shareholders.

The SFC’s main findings are as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Inadequate and sub-standard due diligence work\n\n\n\nThe principal businesses of Hontex and its subsidiaries (the Group) are fabric sales and garment manufacturing (on an Original Equipment Manufacturing basis for apparel owners and for Hontex’s franchisees). Proper due diligence on the Group’s customers, suppliers and franchisees was crucial to the assessment of the authenticity of the Group’s business performance. However, Mega Capital’s due diligence work was inadequate and sub-standard.\n\n\n\nFor example, material information (like transaction figures with the Group) was missing from questionnaires that Mega Capital completed with suppliers and customers; Mega Capital failed to follow-up on the missing information; a number of interviews with suppliers and customers were conducted over the phone in haste on the very day that Hontex filed its listing application; franchisees information provided by Hontex (name, address and turnover of each franchisee) was not properly verified and transaction records between franchisees and the Group were not obtained.\n\n\n\n2. Failure to act independently and impartially\n\n\n\nImportant aspects of Mega Capital’s due diligence work on Hontex’s suppliers, customers and franchisees were sourced from Hontex without independent scrutiny, displaying inappropriate reliance on the issuer.\n\n\n\nFor example, Mega Capital acceded to Hontex’s request that it should not approach the Group’s suppliers, customers and franchisees directly. Accordingly, all interviews were arranged by Hontex and conducted in the presence of Hontex’s representatives. Mega Capital also accepted Hontex’s representation, without any inquiries, that some of its suppliers/customers refused to have face-to-face interviews with Mega Capital.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Mega Capital accepted the arrangement to have telephone interviews with such suppliers/customers arranged by Hontex.\n\n\n\nFinally, written confirmations from franchisees confirming that they were independent from Hontex were obtained through Hontex.\n\n\n\n3. Inadequate audit trail of due diligence work\n\n\n\nMega Capital did not adequately document their due diligence planning and significant aspects of their due diligence work. For example, there are no records showing what background or other due diligence searches had been conducted by Mega Capital on the suppliers, customers and franchisees of the Group.\n\n\n\n4. Inadequate supervision of its staff\n\n\n\nMost of the due diligence work was handled by junior and inexperienced staff of Mega Capital without adequate supervision. Each of the two responsible officers of Mega Capital who were the sponsor principals in relation to Hontex’s listing application denied that they were responsible for the listing application (Note 4).\n\n\n\n5. Breach of sponsor's undertaking and filing untrue declaration with The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK)\n\n\n\nAs a sponsor for Hontex’s listing application, Mega Capital was required and submitted an undertaking and a declaration to SEHK on 23 July 2009 and 15 December 2009 respectively, confirming that Mega Capital would/had made reasonable due diligence inquiries and believed that all information provided to the SEHK during the listing application process of Hontex, including the information contained in the IPO Prospectus, was true in all material respects and did not omit material information. In view of various apparent failures and deficiencies of Mega Capital’s due diligence work identified above, it would appear that Mega Capital was in breach of the undertaking given to the SEHK by failing to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that all information provided to SEHK during Hontex’s listing application did not omit any material information. It would also appear that various declarations made to SEHK, for example, that it had made reasonable due diligence inquiries, were not true.\n\n\n\nMany of Mega Capital’s failures and deficiencies in discharging its sponsor’s duties, as identified above, echo the deficiencies in the work performed by some sponsors that are noted in the Report on Sponsor Theme Inspection Findings published by the SFC in March 2011.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found no evidence that Mega Capital was involved in any fraud and took into account Mega Capital otherwise had a clean record.\n\n\n\nMega Capital denies all allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\n“Mega Capital’s failure in discharging its sponsor’s duties prejudiced the regulatory assessment of Hontex’s suitability for listing and jeopardized the interests of the investing public,” the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward said.\n\n\n\n“Given the important role played by sponsors, these failures must be regarded most grimly. The sanctions imposed on Mega Capital should make it clear that the SFC condemns such failure in the strongest terms,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe SFC acknowledges that there is no evidence that Mega Capital’s parent company in Taiwan, Mega Securities Co., Ltd, was involved in Mega Capital’s sponsorship work on Hontex’s listing application.\n\n\n\nThe SFC’s disciplinary proceedings against Mega Capital are completed but the SFC’s investigation in relation to the listing of Hontex and all other relevant circumstances is continuing.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Mega Capital is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities. The SFC has revoked the Type 6 licence of Mega Capital. There is a licensing condition on Mega Capital’s Type 1 licence that it shall not engage in dealing activities other than those relating to corporate finance.\n\n2. Hontex was listed on the Main Board of SEHK on 24 December 2009. Mega Capital was its sole bookrunner, lead manager and sponsor and KPMG was its auditors and reporting accountants.\n\n3.

Consequently, Hong did not realise that material information (like transaction figures with Hontex) was missing from most of the questionnaires and failed to instruct the transaction team to follow up on the missing information.\n\n\n\n3. Breach of sponsor's undertaking and filing untrue declaration with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK)\n\n\n\nAs sponsor principals for Hontex’s listing application, Hong and Mr X jointly signed and submitted the sponsor’s undertaking and declaration to SEHK respectively, confirming that Mega Capital had made reasonable due diligence inquiries and all information provided to the SEHK was true in all material respects and did not omit any material information.\n\n\n\nHowever, Hong did not take reasonable steps to ensure that the transaction team had conducted due diligence in accordance with the requirements of Practice Note 21; instead, he simply relied on Mr X and the transaction team to ensure the quality of the due diligence work without performing any quality assurance role himself (Note 6).\n\n\n\nThe SFC found that Hong has failed to supervise the execution and ensure the adequacy of the due diligence inquiries performed by the transaction team of Mega Capital.\n\n\n\nThe SFC found no evidence that Hong was involved in any fraud. The SFC has not made findings against Hong for dishonesty or taking unfair advantage from his failures.\n\n\n\n“As a responsible officer and a sponsor principal for Mega Capital, Hong failed to ensure Mega Capital’s transaction team undertook proper and effective due diligence into the claims made by Hontex in its IPO prospectus,” the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward said.\n\n\n\n“Revocation is a very serious sanction and reflects the terrible consequences for the investing public who bought shares in Hontex and who remain substantially out of pocket because of Hontex’s position,” he added.\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Hong was licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities and was accredited with Mega Capital until 1 March 2010. Hong was the responsible officer and managing director of Mega Capital at the time of the conduct in question.\n\n2.

In agreeing the statement of facts, Hontex is agreeing that it contravened section 298 of the SFO. This is sufficient to trigger the Court’s power, under section 213 of the SFO, to make remedial orders if it decides to do so.\n\n3. Section 298 of the SFO, which is a market misconduct provision, prohibits the distribution of materially false or misleading information that is likely to induce another person to subscribe or buy securities if the person knows or is reckless as to whether the information is false or misleading.\n\n4.

RBC also did not have any measure for the overall risk of investment products it sold. Therefore, it was difficult for the RMs to ensure that the advice and recommendations they provided would best fulfill the clients' investment objectives and other circumstances.\r\n\n\t- RBC's RMs did not record or document any product suitability assessment they had undertaken to demonstrate that RBC was reasonably satisfied that the investment products recommended by the RMs were suitable for their clients.\r\n\n\t- RBC did not have adequate procedures in place requiring the RMs to document their investment advice or recommendation and the underlying rationale and to provide a copy of the same to the clients. Therefore, RBC's supervision of RMs could not have been effective in terms of ensuring that recommendations or solicitations made to clients were suitable and reasonable in all the circumstances (Note 2).\r\n\nSince RBC's systems had failed to ensure that its investment recommendations to clients were based on thorough analysis and were reasonable in all the circumstances during the period mentioned, the SFC considers that RBC's breaches are prejudicial to the interest of the investing public.\r\n\nPursuant to the resolution, RBC will:\r\n\n\t- make repurchase offers to all eligible customers at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount invested (Note 3);\r\n\n\t- pay compensation to all its eligible former customers in respect of their previous holding(s) in the relevant non-SFC authorized funds in an amount equal to the repurchase amount less any sale proceeds received (Note 4);\r\n\n\t- immediately implement special enhanced complaints handling procedures to resolve, in a fair and reasonable manner, all complaints in relation to the purchase and sale of investment products or the provision of investment advisory services relating to such purchase and sale; and\r\n\n\t- engage an independent reviewer, to be approved by the SFC, to review its systems and processes in respect of its distribution of unlisted investment products.\r\n\nThe SFC acknowledges RBC's full co-operation to resolve the SFC’s concerns and notes that RBC has strengthened its internal systems and controls in respect of its distribution of unlisted investment products.

The calculation of the interest is based on the full nominal value of the customer’s total investment in the relevant non-SFC authorized funds, or, in the case of eligible customers who have received distributions where the relevant funds have been liquidated and/or payment from RBC, on the outstanding value of the customer’s investment in the relevant non-SFC authorized funds from time to time, taking into account the distributions and/or payments such customers have received, using the average of counter rates from RBC on a 12-month deposit in the currency which the relevant fund was denominated (RBC Rates) (where available) or the average of interest rates quoted on Bloomberg Terminal on a 12-month deposit in the currency which the relevant fund was denominated (where RBC Rates are not available) from the date the eligible customer purchased the relevant fund to the date of the agreement between RBC and SFC for the resolution of its disciplinary action against RBC.\r\n\n\t- Eligible former customers are customers who would otherwise be eligible for the repurchase offer but for their sale of their holding(s) in the relevant non-SFC authorized funds.

The SFC found that these transfers involved funds that had been advanced to them by money changers in both Hong Kong and the Mainland on behalf of Mainland clients. Money for Cho’s clients was routed through Ju’s personal bank account to the securities accounts of Cho’s clients and funds for Ju’s clients were transferred to the securities accounts of Ju’s clients via Cho’s personal bank account.\r\n\nThe effect of the arrangement was to create an additional layer of the fund transfer process disguising the true source of the funds that were being used and prejudicing their employers’ obligations to know the origin of their clients’ money, both of which constitute important information in the prevention and identification of money laundering activities.\r\n\nAccording to Cho and Ju, the funds deposited to their accounts came from their Mainland-based clients. However, they had no actual knowledge to confirm their belief. Nor did they verify whether the money received in Cho’s account was provided by the money changers and whether the relevant clients had transferred the equivalent amount of Renminbi to the money changers’ accounts in the Mainland.\r\n\nCho admitted that he received a service fee from some of these clients for the services he rendered. Cho also admitted that on some occasions the money received from the money changers might be kept in his personal bank account temporarily, if the clients’ securities trading accounts at his employer had not yet been opened.\r\n\nBoth Cho and Ju knew that as licensed representatives and account executives, they should not be personally involved in arranging money transfers for their clients and that by doing so they bypassed processes and requirements of their employers.\r\n\nIn deciding the penalty, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- the manner in which Cho and Ju allowed their personal bank accounts to be used as conduits for transferring funds of unverified sources and their attempts to bypass the internal requirements of their employers were dishonest conduct and posed a serious threat to the integrity of the market;\r\n\n\t- Cho and Ju failed to perform proper know-your-client procedures in that they failed to identify and verify beneficial ownership of the relevant client accounts and the source of the clients’ funds; and\r\n\n\t- a clear message needs to be sent to the market that account executives should not meddle with the settlement procedures of their firms which are designed to protect their firms and their clients from financial loss, fraud and other misconduct.\r\n\nAlthough the SFC is of the view that the nature and seriousness of this matter would have also justified a suspension of Ju’s licence, the SFC decided to reprimand Ju and fine her $100,000 after taking into account the effect on the family of Cho and Ju and recognising Ju’s role was a secondary one with Cho primarily involved in liaising with the money changers and the Mainland clients in arranging the transfer of funds.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Cho is licensed as a representative under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities and was accredited to BOCOM International Securities Limited from 12 September 2007 to 15 November 2013.\r\n\n\t- Ju is licensed as a representative under the SFO to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities and was accredited to Quam Securities Company Limited from 24 February 2005 to 23 October 2010.

The 297 investors had no means to detect they were dealing with Du, who was engaged in illegal insider dealing. If they had known, they would not have sold their shares to him and certainly not at the same price.\"\r\n\n\"Above all, this case sends a clear message that the consequences of wrongdoing, including the costs of restoration or remediation, should be met by wrongdoers and not be borne by innocent investors or the market,\" he added.\r\n\nUnder the restoration orders made by the court today, the SFC will notify CITIC Resources, Morgan Stanley Asia Limited and all 297 investors of the orders and unless there is any valid objection, Du will be required to pay the investors a total amount of $23,964,440 which will be administered by a court appointed administrator, Mr John Lees of JLA Asia.\r\n\nThe payment to be made by Du under the restoration orders represents the difference between the actual price at which the affected investors sold the CITIC Resources shares to Du and the price at which the investors could have sold the shares had the price sensitive information concerning CITIC Resources been made known to the market at the time (as assessed by expert evidence) (Note 3).\r\n\nDu will also pay the SFC’s legal costs and the fees of the court appointed administrators.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- The SFC commenced these proceedings under section 213 of the SFO on 27 July 2007 and obtained interim orders freezing the profits of Du’s insider dealing.

In reducing the fine, the Court of Appeal held that the effect of the fine was to deprive Du’s trading counterparties of the amounts which might be available to them in the proceedings under section 213 of the SFO and thus to defeat the “laudable objectives” of those proceedings.\n\n\n\nPlease see the SFC’s press releases dated 10 September 2009, 18 September 2009, 20 September 2012 and 2 January 2013.\r\n\n\t- Given the counterparties would not have sold the shares if they knew their sell orders might be matched with an illegal insider, they are entitled to be restored to their pre-transaction positions under section 213(2)(b) of the SFO.

During the licence application process, HSBC Securities represented to the SFC that existing clients would be given the option of “opting in”, by signing “opt in letters”, if they wished to participate in the Crossing Service (the “opt in” approach). The SFC granted HSBC Securities a Type 7 licence in March 2011. \r\n\nIn July 2011, the media reported that HSBC proposed to launch the Crossing Service to its retail clients, and that an “opt out” approach would be adopted, whereby clients would effectively be assumed to consent to their trades being matched and crossed on the Crossing Service unless they took the initiative to notify HSBC otherwise. This is contrary to the representations that HSBC Securities had made to the SFC during the licence application process (Notes 2 & 3).\r\n\nAn SFC investigation found that:\r\n\n\t- A preliminary decision by HSBC to change the enrolment approach for retail clients from “opt in” to “opt out” was made in mid-October 2010 but as a result of internal miscommunication, when the SFC specifically queried HSBC Securities in November 2010 whether the “opt in” approach would apply to retail clients, HSBC Securities misrepresented to the SFC that this would be the case.\r\n\n\t- When the decision to change from “opt in” to “opt out” approach for retail clients was confirmed in around December 2010, HSBC Securities failed to notify the SFC about the change as required by the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Registration) (Information) Rules (Note 4).\r\n\nThe SFC considers that HSBC Securities’ failure to ensure the accuracy of information submitted to the SFC in support of its licence application and its failure to notify the SFC about the change from “opt in” to “opt out” approach for retail clients called into question its fitness and properness as a licensed person.\r\n\nIn deciding the sanction, the SFC took into account that HSBC Securities has cooperated with the SFC in resolving the disciplinary action and agreed to engage an independent reviewer to review its access controls concerning trading information in the Crossing Service (Note 5).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- HSBC Securities is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- According to HSBC Securities, in connection with the provision of the Crossing Service, HSBC would be the client facing entity and HSBC Securities’ only client. \r\n\n\t- On 8 August 2011, the SFC imposed a condition on HSBC Securities’ licence to the effect that HSBC Securities shall only provide the Crossing Service to “professional investors”, as defined in the SFO and its subsidiary legislation.\r\n\n\t- The Securities and Futures (Licensing and Registration) (Information) Rules require that certain changes in information that has previously been provided to the SFC in support of a licence application must be communicated to the SFC within seven days after the change takes place. The change from “opt in” approach to “opt out” approach for retail clients was a notifiable change.\r\n\n\t- In August 2012, HSBC Securities informed the SFC that it had discovered that certain functions in its trading system might indirectly have provided unintended internal visibility to orders in the Crossing Service. HSBC Securities suspended the Crossing Service immediately pending resolution of the matter, and has since taken steps to remedy this visibility issue and restarted the Crossing Service in September 2013. \r\n\n\t- A copy of the Statement of Disciplinary Action in relation to the matter is available on the SFC website.","known_entities":"HSBC Securities Brokers (Asia) Limited|HSBC Securities Brokers (Asia) Limited"},{"article_body":"The Court of First Instance today ordered Tiger Asia Management LLC (Tiger Asia) and two of its senior officers, Mr Bill Sung Kook Hwang and Mr Raymond Park (collectively the Tiger Asia parties), to pay $45,266,610 to investors affected by their insider dealing involving two Hong Kong-listed banking stocks (Note 1).\r\n\nThe court orders followed admissions by the Tiger Asia parties in a statement of agreed and admitted facts filed in the Court of First Instance by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in its proceedings under section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) that they contravened Hong Kong’s laws prohibiting insider dealing when dealing in the shares of Bank of China Limited (BOC) and of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) in December 2008 and January 2009 and manipulated the price of CCB shares in January 2009 (Notes 2 & 3).\r\n\nThe Tiger Asia parties have also made the same admissions of insider dealing and manipulation in proceedings commenced by the SFC in the Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT).

Investors are unable to detect, or avoid transacting with, wrongdoers in the market and so they are highly vulnerable to this kind of misconduct. It is right and fair that these transactions should be rescinded so that the 1,800 innocent investors may be put back, as closely as possible, to the positions they were in before the transactions took place.\"\r\n\nToday’s court orders, which were made by consent by the Honourable Mr Justice Harris under section 213(2)(b) of the SFO, will return a total of $45,266,610 (the restoration amount) to around 1,800 investors in Hong Kong and overseas who traded with Tiger Asia in the insider dealing transactions. To facilitate the return of money to the affected investors, the Tiger Asia parties have already paid $45,266,610 into court.   \r\n\nThe restoration amount represents the difference between the actual price of BOC and CCB shares sold by Tiger Asia and the value of those shares taking into account the inside information known to Tiger Asia (as assessed by expert evidence) (Note 5).\r\n\nThe orders include the appointment of Mr John Robert Lees and Mr Kok Wing Chong of JLA Asia as independent administrators to take charge of the distribution of the restoration amount to the counterparties to Tiger Asia’s insider dealing.  \r\n\nAt a directions hearing held yesterday, the MMT fixed three days starting on 7 May 2014 to hear submissions as to what orders, if any, ought to be made against the Tiger Asia parties.\r\n\n\"The SFC looks forward to making further submissions to the MMT on appropriate orders to deter misconduct and to protect the integrity of Hong Kong’s market,\" Mr Steward added.\r\n\nThe SFC appreciates the assistance of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission in this case.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Tiger Asia was founded in 2001 and is a New York-based asset management company that specialises in equity investments in China, Japan and Korea.

In a hearing before the Court of First Instance today, Qunxing denied the allegations (Note 3).\r\n\nThe interim order freezes the total amount of funds raised by Qunxing from the investing public. The SFC is seeking orders to restore public shareholders and warrant holders who bought Qunxing shares and warrants and still hold them to the positions they were in before the transactions (Note 4).\r\n\nThe SFC obtained the interim injunction to stop the dissipation of assets pending the end of its investigation and to ensure there are enough assets to satisfy any restoration or compensation orders, if such orders should be made against Qunxing.\r\n\nSince 12 December 2013, the SFC has only identified assets worth approximately $149 million held in bank accounts and securities accounts of Qunxing and Best Known in Hong Kong.

The dealing system of SHKIS automatically split the erroneous order into 834 smaller orders which were then sent to the market. SHKIS’s real-time credit controls failed to filter the erroneous order due to an incorrect setting in the credit rules (Notes 2 & 3).\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation revealed various weaknesses in SHKIS’ internal controls which contributed to the incident. In particular:\r\n\n\t- SHKIS’ system did not impose a limit on the maximum number of splits allowed for large orders;\r\n\n\t- amendments or changes to the credit rules were not migrated from the testing environment to the production environment directly, but were manually entered into the production environment by a staff member of the Credit Department, increasing the likelihood of input errors; and\r\n\n\t- there was a lack of segregation of duties between the “maker” and the “checker” for changes to the credit rules/policies. In implementing the new credit rules on 29 August 2011, the relevant credit officer deployed, checked, as well as approved the changes. No post-deployment validation was performed by any independent third party to ensure the changes were implemented accurately and completely.\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account that SHKIS has:\r\n\n\t- informed the SFC about the error trade in a timely manner;\r\n\n\t- promptly investigated the incident to ascertain the factors which contributed to the error trade, and engaged an external audit firm to independently conduct a review and give recommendations for system and control enhancements;\r\n\n\t- taken remedial actions to prevent the same incident from re-occurring in the future;\r\n\n\t- cooperated with the SFC in resolving the disciplinary action; and\r\n\n\t- agreed to further engage an independent reviewer to review its order entry risk controls in relation to its cash equities dealing, and to implement all recommendations to be made by the reviewer.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- SHKIS is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- The maximum order size of a stock that is accepted by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited is 3,000 board lots.

It is the SFC’s policy that a CIS is required to be authorized by the SFC under section 104 of the SFO before it is marketed to the public. Authorization of advertising and marketing documents would require all offering and marketing documents to contain sufficient details of the features of the CIS as well as the risks involved.

During the CAS that day, the indicative equilibrium price (IEP) of HSBC shares fell 10.8% from around $37 to $33 (Notes 2 & 3).\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation stemmed from suspicions that the sudden fall in the share price of HSBC was the result of manipulation.\r\n\nThe investigation did not find any manipulation. However, the SFC considered the size of Denk’s orders in the last seconds of the CAS on 9 March 2009 was likely to create undue volatility in the closing price of HSBC. The SFC believed Denk’s conduct was in breach of his obligations under the Code of Conduct to act with due skill, care and diligence, in the best interests of market integrity (Note 4). The SFAT disagreed and delivered its reasons on 20 May 2013 (Note 5).\r\n\nThe SFC alleged that the fall in HSBC share price was the result of the interaction of a number of at-auction sell orders for a total of 5.4 million HSBC shares placed by Denk in the last seconds of the CAS and an at-auction limit sell order for 6,000 HSBC shares at $33 placed earlier by a retail investor (Note 6). Under the CAS algorithm, $33 became the closing price of HSBC shares on 9 March 2009.\r\n\nDenk contended that he was trading on behalf of Deutsche Bank London and placed the at-auction sell orders for hedging purposes (Note 7). There was no connection between DSAL, including Denk, and the retail investor who placed the $33 at-auction limit sell order to offset some of his earlier purchases (Note 8).\r\n\nThe SFC considered that Denk should have managed his hedging requirements well before the market close. As an experienced trader, Denk ought to have known that the size of his orders would likely move the share price in view of the market liquidity in the circumstances.\r\n\nIn its reasons, the SFAT commented on the inherent instability of the closing auction system which meant, amongst other things, that Denk was unable to view the order depth when placing his sell orders. The SFAT also commented on the relevant standard of proof in disciplinary cases.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Denk was licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures) regulated activities and was accredited to DSAL from February 2007 to February 2010.

The CAS was designed to provide an elaborate process to arrive at an IEP which would accommodate the matching of the largest number of shares at the relevant time based on the orders inputted. The CAS was later suspended by HKEx. From 23 March 2009, the securities market closes at 4:00 pm and HKEx uses its pre-CAS method for calculating closing prices for securities.

An at-auction order did not carry an order price and were ranked by their order entry time. At-auction limit orders were first ranked in accordance with their limit price and then by the order entry time.\r\n\n\t- Denk placed his sell orders at 16:09:57, when the IEP was at $37.0. At 16:09:58, Denk finished inputting his last order, when the IEP was driven down to $33. According to Denk, his sell orders were for hedging the option book he managed for Deutsche Bank London. Out of the sell orders of 5.4 million HSBC shares, he could only execute 3,812,000 shares at $33, because there was insufficient liquidity in the market to absorb all his orders. In order to fulfil his hedging requirements, he subsequently sold 1.902 million shares in the London market at $35.39 and another 300,000 shares to another trading desk at Deutsche Bank off the exchange on 9 March 2009.\r\n\n\t- The retail investor placed an at-auction limit sell order for 6,000 HSBC shares at $33 at 16:06:59. According to the retail investor, he bought HSBC shares in the morning trading session on 9 March 2009 with a view to increasing his holding in HSBC in order to take up additional shares in the HSBC 5 for 12 rights issue announced on 2 March 2009. During the day, he bought more HSBC shares to average down his cost for the purchases as the price of HSBC shares kept falling. However, he had insufficient funds to settle all his trades and began to sell his HSBC shares from 14:42 without success.

At the beginning or in the middle of the relevant months, funds were transferred to a company wholly-owned by Lam, leading to a drop in Hampton Securities’ liquid capital to a level below its required amount under the Securities and Futures (Financial Resources) Rules (FRR). At the end of the month, before Hampton Securities submitted its financial return to the SFC, a similar amount of funds would be returned to Hampton Securities either by Lam’s wholly-owned company or his relatives and friends.\r\n\nThe SFC found that the purpose of these repeated transfers was to inflate artificially the liquid assets of Hampton Securities in the calculation of its liquid capital when preparing its monthly financial returns under the FRR. \r\n\nIn addition, the SFC found that Hampton Securities incorrectly included the following items as part of the firm’s liquid assets:\r\n\n\t- funds from Lam’s relatives and friends which were temporarily deposited into Hampton Securities’ bank account at month-ends of July to October 2010; and\r\n\n\t- cheques from Lam’s wholly-owned company given to Hampton Securities at month-ends of November and December 2010 but were not deposited into its bank account.\r\n\nHampton Securities’ liquid capital position as stated in its financial returns submitted to the SFC was therefore inflated or window dressed.\r\n\nThe SFC also found that Hampton Securities had:\r\n\n\t- failed to maintain the minimum level of liquid capital required under the FRR on 189 days during the relevant period and notify the SFC of its liquid capital deficiencies;\r\n\n\t- failed to cease carrying on regulated activity when it was unable to maintain its required liquid capital;\r\n\n\t- provided false and/or misleading information to the SFC in its financial returns submitted under the FRR;\r\n\n\t- failed to put in place adequate and effective internal controls and procedures to ensure its compliance with the FRR; and\r\n\n\t- held client money in its house account, in breach of the condition of its licence and the Securities and Futures (Client Money) Rules (Note 3).\r\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said: “The FRR represents important statutory safeguards for the interests of clients and creditors of licensed corporations and are fundamental to the proper functioning of the Hong Kong market.

(RBS), formerly known as ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (ABN Amro), in relation to the sale of Lehman Brothers-related equity-linked notes (LB-ELNs) to retail clients between July 2007 and May 2008 (Notes 1, 2 & 3).\r\n\nRBS has agreed, without admitting any liability, to make a repurchase offer to all eligible customers holding outstanding LB-ELNs sold by the bank (including those sold by ABN Amro in Hong Kong before the acquisition by RBS of ABN Amro’s retail and commercial banking business) at 100% of the principal value of each eligible customer’s investment in the LB-ELNs. Today’s resolution provides them an opportunity to reverse their purchase of the outstanding LB-ELNs.\r\n\nThe SFC estimates about 540 customers are eligible for the repurchase offer under this resolution which, if accepted by all, will lead to payments totalling approximately $513 million.\r\n\nThe eligible customers are retail customers holding outstanding LB-ELNs who were assessed to have a risk tolerance level that was more conservative than the risk rating assigned to the LB-ELN purchased by the customer. The risk profiling process in issue in this case was developed by ABN Amro prior to RBS’ acquisition of ABN Amro’s retail and commercial banking business.\r\n\nThe repurchase offer will not be offered to professional investors. The SFC’s investigation into the handling of professional investors by RBS in respect to LB-ELNs is continuing (Note 4).\r\n\nRBS will also make top-up payments to retail customers with whom RBS has entered into settlement agreements in respect of their holding of outstanding LB-ELNs but would otherwise have been eligible to receive a repurchase offer to ensure these customers are treated in the same way as other customers participating in the repurchase scheme.\r\n\nThe offer price will exclude the amount of coupon already paid to eligible customers and any recovery by the eligible customers in respect of the relevant LB-ELNs out of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. or its related entities. The offer price will include an additional amount representing the interest that would have been earned if the amount invested in the LB-ELNs had been invested with the bank on a savings deposit (Note 5).\r\n\nDuring the course of the SFC’s investigation, the SFC raised a number of concerns with RBS regarding the risk assessment and the risk matching process used by the bank at the time, in particular:\r\n\n\t- Each customer was provided with a risk profiling questionnaire in which answers were scored. The customer’s ultimate risk score determined their risk profile or tolerance level which, in turn, was used to assess the relative suitability of LB-ELNs for each customer. However, the scores assigned to two out of 12 questions in the risk profiling questionnaire were weighted erroneously which led to some customers’ risk tolerance level being assessed as higher than it should have been if the correct weighting had been applied (Note 6);\r\n\n\t- Further, the bank classified all series of LB-ELNs, except for two, as high risk products under its three-level risk rating system. However, the LB-ELNs were sold to customers who were assessed to have a medium or low risk tolerance level without proper records of justification for so doing (Note 7).\r\n\nIn entering into this agreement under section 201 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), the SFC has taken into account:\r\n\n\t- there is no distributable collateral for the LB-ELNs. As such, there is less chance for LB-ELN customers to receive any substantial payment or dividend in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy proceedings (Note 8);\r\n\n\t- the repurchase scheme will enable eligible customers to receive 100% of the principal value invested in the LB-ELNs without the costs and risks of separate legal proceedings;\r\n\n\t- the processes that caused concern for the SFC were not devised by RBS which inherited these issues following its acquisition of ABN Amro’s retail and commercial banking business;\r\n\n\t- RBS will review complaints lodged by LB-ELN customers who are not eligible for the repurchase offer under its enhanced complaint handling procedures. The case by case enhanced complaint handling procedures should address any other possible irregularities in the sale of the LB-ELNs to customers with high risk tolerance level under RBS’ risk profiling processes;\r\n\n\t- this outcome could not have been achieved through the imposition of disciplinary sanctions by the SFC against RBS and/or its staff, even if such action was successful; and\r\n\n\t- the agreement will bring the matter to an appropriate end for the benefit of RBS and those customers who participate in the repurchase scheme.\r\n\n\"This was a time consuming investigation that involved our investigators combing through tens of thousands of documents and listening to hours of telephone recordings. The problems caused by the errors in ABN Amro’s processes should send a warning to all intermediaries who seek to automate suitability processes with matching systems. An automated process cannot replace governance disciplines and professional judgement in assessing whether an investment advice or recommendation is reasonably suitable for the customer,\" the SFC’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ashley Alder said.  \r\n\nMs Meena Datwani, Acting Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, said, \"This agreement with RBS represents the outcome of the investigatory efforts by the two regulatory authorities. The HKMA considers the agreement to be in the interests of the investing public as it allows eligible customers to recover the money they invested without the need to go through lengthy and costly legal processes.\"\r\n\nIn view of the repurchase scheme, the SFC will not impose disciplinary sanctions against the bank and its current or former officers or employees in relation to the sale of the LB-ELNs to RBS’ retail customers (other than professional investors), save for any acts of dishonesty, fraud, deception or conduct that is criminal in nature.\r\n\nThe HKMA has also informed the bank that it does not intend to take any enforcement action against their executive officers and relevant individuals in connection with the sale of LB-ELNs to customers who have accepted the repurchase offers or the top-up payments under the repurchase scheme, except for any acts of dishonesty, fraud, deception or conduct that is criminal in nature.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- RBS is a registered institution under the SFO to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities. RBS acquired ABN Amro’s retail and commercial banking business in October 2007 during the period in which the SFC’s concerns arose. However, the resolution agreement is with RBS and RBS is responsible for implementing and performing the repurchase agreement.\r\n\n\t- Between July 2007 and May 2008, the bank sold to its customers equity-linked notes issued by Lehman Brothers Treasury Co. B.V. and equity-linked notes issued by Allegro Investment Corporation of which Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. was one of the referenced entities. The LB-ELNs were sold by RBS on a private placement basis.\r\n\n\t- Among the LB-ELNs sold by the bank to its customers, 44 series were outstanding at the time Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008. The total principal value of the outstanding LB-ELNs is approximately $784 million.\r\n\n\t- Professional investors are those customers who: (a) fall under paragraphs (a) to (i) of the definition of “professional investors” in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the SFO; or (b) fall under section 3 of the Securities and Futures (Professional Investor) Rules (Cap. 571D) and classified by the bank and agreed by the customers to be treated as such in accordance with paragraphs 15.3 and 15.4 of the Code of Conduct at the time they purchased the relevant LB-ELNs. Based on evidence gathered to date, there are about 10 professional investors who purchased LB-ELNs from the bank that remain outstanding.\r\n\n\t- The calculation of the interest is based on the full nominal value of the eligible customer’s total investment in outstanding LB-ELNs using the bank’s savings deposit rates for the period from the issue date of the relevant LB-ELNs up to today’s date.\r\n\n\t- Under ABN Amro’s scoring system, a lower score indicated a higher tolerance of risk. Two questions were scored incorrectly with one question giving customers with less investment experience a lower rather than a higher score and another question giving a lower rather than higher score to customers who wished to invest lower proportion of assets in other than risk free deposits. About 80 out of 1115 transactions were affected by this issue. The scoring errors were rectified by the bank in June 2008. In determining whether the client is eligible for a repurchase offer, the client’s risk tolerance level will be computed based on the rectified scores.\r\n\n\t- Among the 44 outstanding series of the LB-ELNs, two series were principal-protected, i.e. the issuer will pay back 100% of the principal amount to the investor at the maturity date. The bank had rated these principal-protected LB-ELNs as “Balanced” product. The rest of the outstanding series were not principal-protected and the bank had rated these non-principal protected LB-ELNs as “Growth” product.\r\n\n\t- In the unlikely event that it is determined at a later date that a customer accepting a repurchase offer would have received a greater amount as an unsecured creditor in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy proceedings, RBS has agreed to pay the difference to that customer, such that no customer shall be disadvantaged by participating in the repurchase scheme.\r\n\n\t- Please follow this link for a set of questions and answers about the Repurchase Scheme.","known_entities":"Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., The|Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., The"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has presented a petition to the Court of First Instance to wind up China Metal Recycling (Holdings) Limited (China Metal Recycling).\r\n\nThis is the first time the SFC has applied to the court under section 212 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to wind up a Hong Kong-listed company to protect the interests of the company’s shareholders and creditors, and the investing public (Note 1).\r\n\nThe SFC has also obtained orders from the court to appoint Cosimo Borrelli and Jocelyn Chi Lai Man, both of Borrelli Walsh Limited, as joint and several provisional liquidators for China Metal Recycling.\r\n\nThese applications follow an SFC investigation that found evidence suggesting that China Metal Recycling has overstated its financial position in the prospectus used for its initial public offering in 2009 and in its annual report for 2009.

The sales and transfers were carried out pursuant to instructions that were sent to Lee at A One’s email account (the Email Instructions) from an email account that the client had previously used in his communications with A One. The client denied that the instructions were given by him and claimed that his email account had been compromised.\r\n\nThe SFC also found that:\r\n\n\t- A One did not have any manual, written policy or procedure for handling client requests to transfer funds to third party accounts.\r\n\n\t- A One claimed that clients who requested to transfer funds to third party accounts were required to provide a signed authorization letter, so that the client’s signature could be verified by comparing it against the signature on his/her account opening documents. However, A One never received the original signed authorization letters for the above 13 transfers. It received a scanned copy of the signed authorization letter on the day it processed the client’s request for only one of the transfers. In all other cases, scanned copies of the signed authorization letters were received only after the transfers had been completed.\r\n\n\t- A One did not take any other step to verify the identity of the person who gave instructions for the sales and the transfers, or to verify the authenticity of the instructions.\r\n\n\t- Although two responsible officers were required to endorse the remittance application form (which gives the bank instructions to effect a remittance), it does not appear that they bore any responsibility for verifying the authenticity of the client’s instructions.\r\n\n\t- The circumstances of the transfers did not accord with the historical pattern of transfers from the relevant client’s account to third party bank accounts, but A One made no enquiries to satisfy itself that the transfers were reasonable.\r\n\nThe SFC found that A One has failed to ensure that client assets are adequately safeguarded and has failed to establish effective internal control procedures for ensuring that client assets are protected from theft, fraud and other acts of misappropriation. The SFC also found that A One has failed to effectively monitor activities in its clients’ accounts to mitigate the risks of money laundering.    \r\n\nThe SFC found that in response to the Email Instructions, Lee set in train the chain of events that facilitated the unauthorized transfers from the relevant client’s account. In her capacity as a responsible officer of A One, Lee was primarily responsible for ensuring the maintenance of appropriate standards of conduct and adherence to proper procedures by A One. She should have ensured that A One’s procedures in handling client requests to transfer funds to third party accounts adequately safeguarded client assets. However, the SFC found that she acted negligently in handling the relevant transfers and failed to properly discharge her managerial duties. Therefore, A One’s failures are attributable to her.\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including that A One agreed to pay compensation to the client, and that A One and Lee co-operated with the SFC and have no previous disciplinary record.\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation into suspected offences involving fraudulent or deceptive devices, etc in transactions in securities, futures contracts or leveraged foreign exchange trading under section 300 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance is continuing.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- A One is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- Lee is licensed under the SFO to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.

At the material time, Wang was a substantial shareholder of China Best and Ma was his wife.\r\n\nSpecifically, the SFC alleges that:\r\n\n\t- The seller in the proposed acquisition, Asset Rich International Limited (Asset Rich), and its ultimate beneficial shareholder were nominees of Wang and therefore not third parties independent of China Best. A total of $155 million paid by China Best and its subsidiaries to Asset Rich for the purpose of the proposed acquisition ended up being used to discharge Wang’s personal loans or paid to Wang’s personal company. Wang, therefore, profited from the proposed acquisition and had a material interest in the acquisition. However, Wang failed to disclose any of this to China Best’s board of directors.\r\n\n\t- China Best falsely represented in two announcements issued on 3 March and 3 December 2008, respectively, that Asset Rich was an independent third party.\r\n\n\t- Ma and Zhang failed to inform China Best’s board of directors that the ultimate beneficial shareholder of Asset Rich was not an independent third party and had wrongfully authorized the issue of the two announcements.\r\n\n\t- When China Best terminated the proposed acquisition following an enquiry by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, Asset Rich failed to refund the cash deposit of $305 million to Clearmind on time. Accordingly, Asset Rich was obliged under the relevant agreement to pay interest accrued on the cash deposit to Clearmind. Wang, however, wrongfully agreed to waive the accrued interest, resulting in loss to Clearmind and/or China Best.\r\n\nAs part of the legal proceedings, the SFC is also seeking court orders that China Best shall bring in its name, or procure Clearmind to bring in its name, court proceedings against Asset Rich to recover the interest accrued on the $305 million cash deposit.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- China Best was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 26 March 1996.

It related to a disclosable and connected transaction in respect of an acquisition by its subsidiary, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited, of a 49% interest in FAW Toyota 4S company and a 50% interest in Lexus 4S Company and related shareholders’ loans.\r\n\n3.  CITIC disclosed in the Profit Warning that its results for the financial year ending 31 December 2008 were expected to be affected by a loss arising from certain leveraged foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group with a view to minimizing currency exposure of its iron ore mining project in Australia. It was also disclosed that from 1 July to 17 October 2008, CITIC incurred an aggregate realised loss of $807.7 million as a result of the termination of the leveraged foreign exchange contracts, actions relating to managing the exposure to Australian dollar (AUD) and taking delivery of foreign currencies including AUD pursuant to the leveraged foreign exchange contracts. As at 17 October 2008, the mark to market loss of the outstanding leveraged foreign exchange contracts amounted to $14.7 billion.\r\n\nThe leveraged foreign exchange contracts entered into by CITIC included, among others, target redemption forward contracts. Under a target redemption forward contract, the strike rates for buying a specific foreign currency during the contract period are fixed. If the spot rate on any given day during the contract period is equal to or above the strike rate, a notional amount of the foreign currency will be delivered at the strike rate. The difference between the strike rate and the spot rate will be treated as a profit in respect of that particular contract and when the cumulative profit reaches the maximum profit stipulated in the contract, that particular contract will be knocked-out (i.e. the obligation of the counterparty to deliver the foreign currency will cease). If the spot rate is below the strike rate, a pre-determined amount of the foreign currency (which is greater than the notional amount) will be delivered at the strike rate. In this case, the value of the foreign currency delivered will be less than the strike rate paid for it, creating losses. However, there is no similar knock-out feature for losses.\r\n\n4.  In relation to the proceedings in the Court of First Instance, the SFC alleges that there has been a contravention of sections 277 or 298 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Both are market misconduct provisions which prohibit the distribution of materially false or misleading information that is likely to induce another person to subscribe for or buy securities or is likely to have a price effect on the company’s securities.\r\n\n5.  During the period between the date of the Circular and the date of the Profit Warning, there were total purchases over approximately $1.9 billion at various acquisition prices between $14.26 and $24.5 with an average acquisition price of $18.97. The restoration or compensation amount, if any, may depend on a number of additional variables, including each purchaser’s acquisition price, whether the purchaser continues to hold the shares or, alternatively, the sale price.","known_entities":"CHANG Li Hsien Leslie|CHAU Chi Yin|Citic Limited|FAN Hung Ling Henry|LEE Chung Hing Peter|YUNG Chi Kin Larry|Chi Yin CHAU|Henry FAN|Hung Ling FAN|Henry Hung Ling FAN|Leslie Li Hsien CHANG|Li Hsien CHANG|Leslie CHANG|Citic Limited|Larry Chi Kin YUNG|Larry YUNG|Chi Kin YUNG|Chung Hing LEE|Peter Chung Hing LEE|Peter LEE"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has suspended Mr Eric Shum Kam Chi as a representative in all regulated activities and withdrawn approval for him to act as a responsible officer for three years from 15 September 2014 to 14 September 2017 for serious deficiencies in the sponsor work relating to the listing of Sino-Life Group Limited (Sino-Life) on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) (Note 1).\r\n\nShum was previously a responsible officer and sponsor principal of Sun Hung Kai International Limited (Sun Hung Kai International) which acted as the sole sponsor for Sino-Life.\r\n\nAn SFC investigation revealed that Sun Hung Kai International had failed to conduct proper due diligence between October 2007 and September 2009 on Sino-Life’s business in relation to a number of material issues, and had placed undue reliance on the work delegated to external experts. Disciplinary action against Sun Hung Kai International was taken in January 2014 (Note 2).\r\n\nSun Hung Kai International’s regulatory breaches are attributable to Shum who failed to discharge his duties as its senior management. In summary, the SFC found that Shum as head of the firm’s transaction team had failed to:\r\n\n\t- assess the accuracy and the completeness of the information submitted by Sino-Life to demonstrate that it satisfied the financial requirements to list on the GEM;\r\n\n\t- ascertain the existence of various encumbrances on the title of a major business deal of Sino-Life in Taiwan;\r\n\n\t- properly assess the business of the Sino-Life’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Taiwan;\r\n\n\t- ensure true, accurate and complete disclosure was made to the SEHK and in Sino-Life’s prospectus and breached the sponsor undertaking to the SEHK by filing untrue statements in the sponsor declaration; and\r\n\n\t- keep proper books and records in relation to the sponsor work conducted. \r\n\nShum sought to review the SFC’s decision at the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal (SFAT) but withdrew his application before the SFAT hearing. \r\n\nIn deciding the penalty, the SFC took into account that although Shum had knowledge of the fact that Sun Hung Kai International was selective in its disclosure to the SEHK during the listing process, he still signed the sponsor declaration thereby holding out that all information submitted to the SEHK was true, accurate and complete to his knowledge. The SFC also took into account his otherwise clean disciplinary record.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Shum is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activity and was accredited to Sun Hung Kai International between 29 March 2000 and 10 July 2010. Shum is not currently accredited to any principal.\r\n\n\t- Please see the SFC’s press release dated 27 January 2014 and the Reasons for Determination which is available on the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal’s website (http://www.sfat.gov.hk/).","known_entities":"SHUM Kam Chi, Eric|Eric Kam Chi SHUM|Kam Chi SHUM|Eric SHUM"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has commenced legal proceedings in the Court of First Instance against the former chairman, Mr Tong Shek Lun, and two former executive directors, namely Ms Kinny Ko Lai King and Ms Regina Chung Wai Yu, of Sinogreen Energy International Group Limited (Sinogreen) (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nThe SFC alleges that Tong, Ko and Chung had breached their duties as directors of Sinogreen in disposing of a subsidiary in 2008 resulting in loss to Sinogreen. The SFC is seeking court orders that the three former directors be disqualified as company directors and pay compensation to Sinogreen for the loss allegedly caused by their misconduct (Notes 3 & 4).\r\n\nThe SFC’s action follows an investigation into Sinogreen’s disposal of a subsidiary which engaged in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards on the Mainland (the Disposal). The SFC alleges that:\r\n\n\t- in the course of negotiating the Disposal with the purchaser, Tong entered into a secret agreement with the purchaser via a private company and received a secret profit of US$1 million (Note 5).\r\n\n\t- Tong was required to and failed to make full and proper disclosure of his interests in the arrangement with the purchaser to Sinogreen, his fellow directors, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) and Sinogreen’s shareholders.\r\n\n\t- Ko and Chung failed to act with due care and diligence and to make full and proper inquiries about the Disposal before approving it.\r\n\n\t- Tong, Ko and Chung failed to ensure Sinogreen fully complied with disclosure and approval requirements under the Listing Rules of SEHK (Note 6).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Sinogreen, formerly known as Karce International Holdings Company Limited, was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) on 13 March 1998. Sinogreen was principally engaged in the business of the manufacture of and trading in electronic products, conductive silicon rubber keypads, printed circuit boards, and telecommunication products and investment holdings.\r\n\n\t- The legal proceedings were commenced under section 214 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). The first hearing of the petition presented by the SFC will be heard in the Court of First Instance on 16 December 2014.\r\n\n\t- Under section 214 of the SFO, the court may, among other things, make orders to disqualify a person from being a director or being involved, directly or indirectly, in the management of any corporation for up to 15 years, if the person is found to be wholly or partly responsible for the company’s affairs having been conducted in a manner involving defalcation, fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or its members or resulting in members not having been given all the information that they might reasonably expect. The court may also order a company to bring proceedings in its own name against any person specified in the order and may make any other order it considers appropriate.\r\n\n\t- The disposal concerns the selling of 100% of the equity interest in Jet Master Limited (Jet Master) by Sinogreen’s indirect wholly owned subsidiary, China Ample Investments Limited (China Ample) to KFE Hong Kong Limited (KFE Hong Kong) in 2008. Jet Master held Dongguan Tai Shan Electronics Co Limited, which ran a factory manufacturing printed circuit boards on the Mainland (the PCB factory).\r\n\n\t- The SFC alleges that the total considerations for the Disposal was originally set at US$ 4 million as per an initial term sheet dated 28 July 2008. Pursuant to the term sheet, Sinogreen would, among other things, undertake to help KFE Hong Kong upgrade the sewage facilities of the PCB factory. On 12 and 26 September 2008, Tong, on behalf of Sinogreen, signed sale and purchase agreements with KFE Hong Kong which stipulated that the considerations for the Disposal would be US$3 million only. Also on 26 September 2008, Tong signed a consultancy agreement (Consultancy Agreement) on behalf of his wholly owned company called Extract Group Limited (Extract Group) with KFE Hong Kong, pursuant to which Extract Group would take up the sewage upgrading project for the PCB factory and receive consultancy fees of US$1 million.\r\n\n\t- The SFC alleges that when taking into account the Consultancy Agreement the Disposal should have been treated as a major transaction and a connected transaction under the Listing Rules of SEHK, and thus Sinogreen had failed to comply with the disclosure and approval requirements applicable to a major transaction and a connected transaction.","known_entities":"CHUNG Wai Yu Regina|KO Lai King Kinny|TONG Shek Lun|Shek Lun TONG|Lai King Kinny KO|Regina CHUNG|Regina Wai Yu CHUNG|Wai Yu CHUNG"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has revoked the licence of Mr John David Lawrence, a representative of PFC International Company Limited (PFC), and fined him $900,000 for failings relating to his sale of the EEA Life Settlements Fund (Fund) to clients (Notes 1, 2 & 3).\r\n\nAn SFC investigation revealed that from March 2009 to October 2011, Lawrence, who was the chairman and a responsible officer of PFC at the material time, sold the Fund to 31 client accounts involving transaction amount of approximately $28 million, although PFC had classified the Fund as “execution only” and should not be promoted to clients (Note 4).\r\n\nA significant number of clients who bought the Fund through Lawrence were elderly clients despite the liquidity risk of the Fund and the risk of deferral of redemption requests associated with the Fund (Note 5).  \r\n\nThe SFC found that Lawrence had failed:\r\n\n\t- to ensure the suitability of the Fund to his clients;\r\n\n\t- to ensure that the risks associated with the Fund were fully disclosed to his clients;\r\n\n\t- to document the investment advice given to his clients in respect of the Fund, and the rationale underlying the advice and to provide clients with a copy of the written advice; and\r\n\n\t- as a member of PFC’s senior management, to set appropriate standards for his staff to follow to ensure the suitability of products recommended to clients.\r\n\nLawrence’s misconduct calls into question his fitness and properness to remain a licensed person.

The MMT has also issued cease and desist orders against both Tiger Asia and Hwang (Note 3).  \r\n\nThis was the first case directly presented to the MMT by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) (Note 4).\r\n\nTiger Asia and Hwang had argued no orders should be made against them by the MMT.\r\n\nTiger Asia, Hwang and Park admitted they contravened Hong Kong’s laws prohibiting insider dealing when dealing in the shares of Bank of China Limited (BOC) and of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) in December 2008 and January 2009 and manipulated the price of CCB shares in January 2009 (Note 5).  \r\n\nIn its decision, the MMT found that Hwang’s conduct constituted \"serious misconduct\" and show that \"little trust can be placed in Bill Hwang’s integrity\".\r\n\nIn determining a banning period of four years, the MMT warned that \"this heralds a sterner approach in respect of protective measures provided under our law. We are, however, unanimously of the view that the protection of our market is a matter of such public importance, and cold shoulder orders so central to providing that protection, that market operators who, by their actions, show they cannot be trusted must from now on expect orders that exclude them from the market for more lengthy periods of time.\" (Note 6)\r\n\nThe SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said: \"Tiger Asia and Hwang abused the trust of the Hong Kong market, flouted Hong Kong’s laws and damaged the financial interests of thousands of investors who had no means of protecting themselves from such misconduct.

Since August 2012, Tiger Asia has become a “family office” of Hwang and renamed as “Archegos Capital Management LLC” serving as the investment manager for Archegos Fund LP and Archegos Fund Ltd in Hwang’s family office. The SFC accepts that Mr William Tomita, one of the specified persons in the proceedings in the MMT, was a junior member of staff responsible for supporting Tiger Asia’s trading activities, consistently acting on the instructions of Hwang and Park and not knowingly involved in the market misconduct.\r\n\n\t- Under section 257 (1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), a cold shoulder order is an order that the person shall not, without the leave of the Court of First Instance, in Hong Kong, directly or indirectly, in any way acquire, dispose of or otherwise deal in any securities, futures contract or leveraged foreign exchange contract, or an interest in any securities, futures contract, leveraged foreign exchange contract or collective investment scheme for the period (not exceeding five years) specified in the order.\n\n\n\nUnder section 257(1)(c) of the SFO, a cease and desist order is an order that the person shall not again perpetrate any conduct which constitutes such market misconduct.\r\n\n\t- Under section 252A of the SFO, which was introduced in 2012, the SFC was given direct access to the MMT. Formerly only the Financial Secretary could initiate proceedings in the MMT.\r\n\n\t- The admissions made by Tiger Asia, Hwang and Park cover all the allegations made against them by the SFC when it commenced these proceedings in 2009.

Payment of the compensation is dependent upon GOME’s independent shareholders passing the ratification resolution.\r\n\nThe SFC considers the amount proposed to be paid to GOME, subject to approval at the SGM, constitutes a proper expiation of the gains of Wong and the loss to GOME as a result of the breaches by Wong and Du. Wong and Du also agreed to pay all costs involved in convening and holding the SGM and will pay the SFC’s legal costs.\r\n\nUpon payments of the sums as stated above and the ratification of the relevant breaches of Wong and Du arising from the Share Repurchase being obtained at the SGM, the SFC will terminate the proceedings and not initiate any further action in respect of this matter (Note 6).\r\n\nIn entering into the agreement with Wong and Du, the SFC took into account:\r\n\n\t- the agreement will enable GOME to receive in full the compensation calculated on the basis of the independent expert valuation without the costs and risks of separate legal proceedings;\r\n\n\t- Wong and Du have accepted their wrongdoings as aforementioned and by paying a sum higher than their own valuation, they can now do right by GOME and its minority shareholders (Note 7);\r\n\n\t- GOME shareholders will be given an opportunity to consider whether to approve the resolutions to ratify various breaches by Wong and Du; and\r\n\n\t- the agreement will bring the matter to an appropriate end for the benefit of the minority shareholders of GOME.\r\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward, said: \"Hong Kong listed companies are not personal fiefdoms. Corporate actions must be properly authorized, they must have proper purposes and fundamentally directors must take into account the best interests of the company and all its shareholders. It is right that the minority shareholders will now have the opportunity to scrutinise the matter for themselves and decide whether the misconduct should be ratified.\"\r\n\n\"The SFC will continue to take what action is necessary to ensure the interests of the investing public are adequately protected and, where appropriate, to ensure listed company directors are accountable for breaches of duty that harm the interests of the company and the market,\" Mr Steward added.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- The parties agreed and jointly appointed Mr John L Saunders, SBS, a former High Court Judge, to serve as an independent mediator to mediate the matter.\r\n\n\t- The SFC’s proceedings were commenced under section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance. The Court of First Instance granted an interim injunction to freeze assets of up to $1,655,167,000 in August 2009. The injunction against the two companies was later discharged on 8 September 2009 upon deposit with the court of share certificates representing 779,255,678 shares of GOME (the value of which was approximately equivalent at the then share price to the value of assets frozen under the injunction) and the injunction against Du was discharged on 2 March 2011. Please see the SFC’s press releases dated 7 August 2009, 8 September 2009 and 3 March 2011.\r\n\n\t- Between 22 January 2008 and 5 February 2008, GOME bought back on-market an aggregate of 129.8 million of its shares worth approximately $2.2 billion.\r\n\n\t- On 22 May 2007, the shareholders of GOME granted a general mandate for share repurchases where to do so was in the best interests of the Company on terms favourable to the Company. On 21 January 2008, the Share Repurchase was authorized by a meeting of the executive directors of the Company but no notice of meeting had been sent to the non-executive directors. The minutes of meeting recorded that the executive directors considered that in view of the sub-prime event in the US and the appreciation of the renminbi, the share price was below its intrinsic value, GOME had not identified any investment opportunity and the Share Repurchase was in the best interests of the Company. The resolution approving the Share Repurchase was not accompanied by any analysis of these or any other matters. The Share Repurchase commenced the next day. Under Rule 10.06(2) of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, GOME is prevented from repurchasing any shares held by Wong under an on-market offer and under Rule 2 of the SFC’s Codes on Takeovers and Mergers and Share Repurchases (now known as Codes on Takeovers and Mergers and Share Buy-backs), any off-market purchase of Wong’s shares by GOME would have required prior approval of the SFC. In the circumstances, both these rules were breached.\r\n\n\t- The amount alleged by the SFC in calculating the gains accrued to Wong is less than the amount that was frozen by the court when the SFC commenced these proceedings as it follows revised expert advice obtained by the SFC on the proper approach to be made in valuing the unauthorized gains of Wong and the loss to GOME. The calculation of interest is based on the prime rate plus 2% per annum from 5 February 2008 until payment is made by Wong into court or other arrangement is agreed with the SFC.\r\n\n\t- Assuming the resolution is approved, the SFC will file a Notice of Discontinuance to the court.\r\n\n\t- The amount to be paid by Wong and Du is more than the amount suggested by the independent expert valuation retained by them. However, they have agreed to pay the amount determined by valuation of an independent expert appointed by the SFC in the interest of resolving the litigation in a manner which will without any shadow of doubt cause GOME to receive full compensation.","known_entities":"DU Juan|WONG Kwong Yu|Juan DU|Kwong Yu WONG"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has banned Mr Poon Ming Pui from re-entering the industry for 10 months from 9 January 2014 to 8 November 2014 (Note 1).\r\n\nThe disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation which found that between June 2005 and April 2011, Poon conducted personal trading activities through securities accounts of others, and concealed his beneficial interests in and his personal trading activities conducted through these securities accounts from his then employers.\r\n\nNo client suffered any loss as a result of these activities.

The court rejected this argument and found that in this case the nominal or displayed price was an appropriate reference point from which to assess whether Li’s conduct had the effect of rigging the price for VST shares.\r\n\nThe court said the nominal price, in this case, is the relevant price as it was “precise, readily calculable…and easily understood” and took into account “actual transactions (i.e., the last traded price) as well as the most likely transaction price indicated by the highest bid and lowest ask queues, and…reflects general or specific market sentiment which may govern those transactions.”\r\n\nLi was convicted on 22 October 2012 after a trial in the District Court and sentenced to six months of imprisonment in this case prosecuted by the Department of Justice (Note 1).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Please see the SFC’s press releases dated 30 September 2010, 25 November 2010, 14 December 2010, 15 September 2011, 22 October 2012 and 31 October 2012.","known_entities":"LI Jialin|Jialin LI"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has suspended Ms Pat Siu Mei Yee for six months from 29 March 2014 to 28 September 2014 (Note 1).\r\n\nAn SFC investigation found that between 2004 and 2011, Siu entered into an arrangement with a client where the client would sign blank dealing tickets in advance for her to conduct discretionary trading in the client’s account.

The application was made in the SFC’s ongoing proceedings against Qunxing and its subsidiary, Best Known Group Limited (Best Known) (Note 1).\r\n\nThe Hon Mr Justice To appointed Mr Roderick John Sutton, Mr Fok Hei Yu and Mr John Howard Batchelor of FTI Consulting jointly and severally as interim receivers and managers of Qunxing.\r\n\nThe SFC made the urgent application after finding out that a PRC court had accepted an application under the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC from Qunxing’s wholly-owned Mainland-based subsidiary, Shandong Qunxing Paper Limited (Shandong Qunxing). It appears from the PRC court file that the PRC court accepted Shandong Qunxing’s restructuring application on 21 February 2014 and appointed Shandong Qunxing’s liquidation committee as its administrator on 28 February 2014 (Note 2).\r\n\nGiven Shandong Qunxing is the sole operational arm of Qunxing, Qunxing’s most recent interim consolidated financial report claims that it has net assets of RMB3,268 million, most of which are held by Shandong Qunxing, the SFC believes the commencement of PRC bankruptcy proceedings by Shandong Qunxing is important price sensitive information that ought to have been disclosed by Qunxing on or before 21 February 2014 (Note 3).\r\n\nNo announcement has been made to The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited by Qunxing about this application which the SFC alleges contravenes Qunxing’s obligation to keep the market properly informed about its affairs (Note 4).\r\n\nThe SFC queried Qunxing about the PRC bankruptcy proceedings as soon as the SFC learned about them. Three days later, on 21 March 2014, Qunxing issued an announcement stating that all but one of the directors of the company had resigned. The announcement did not make any mention about the PRC bankruptcy proceedings.\r\n\nThe SFC alleges Qunxing has kept its shareholders, the wider Hong Kong market and the SFC completely in the dark. Despite being queried by the SFC, Qunxing continues to fail to inform the investing public of these matters.\r\n\nThe SFC considers the above series of events raise grave concerns that the interests of Qunxing’s public shareholders are in jeopardy, hence the need for an urgent application to appoint receivers and managers for Qunxing.\r\n\nThe Hon Mr Justice To granted the interim receivers and managers wide powers to investigate and manage Qunxing’s affairs. The immediate effect of the appointment of the interim receivers and managers is to suspend the powers of the current board of directors over the management of the company’s affairs and place administrative control over the company in the hands of the interim receivers and managers.\r\n\nThe court will hear the matter again on 4 April 2014 to decide whether to continue the appointment of the interim receivers and managers.\r\n\nSeparately, Qunxing and Best Known have made an application to the court to discharge the injunction order granted on 12 December 2013 to freeze their assets. The court will also hear this application on 4 April 2014.\r\n\nThe SFC is considering further action given its concerns about the uninformed state of the market in respect of Qunxing’s affairs.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- On 12 December 2013, the SFC commenced proceedings against Qunxing and Best Known alleging that Qunxing’s prospectus for its initial public offer in 2007 and the announcements of its annual results for 2007 to 2011 contained materially false or misleading information. On the same day, the SFC obtained an interim injunction freezing assets of up to $1,968,000,000. On 28 March 2014, the SFC made the application to seek an order under section 21L of the High Court Ordinance which empowers the court to grant, among other things, an order to appoint receivers in the ongoing proceedings brought by the SFC under section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) on the grounds that it appears to the court to be just or convenient to do so. The order was obtained on an ex parte basis with notice. Qunxing was represented by its lawyers at the ex parte hearing. Please see the SFC’s press releases dated 20 December 2013 and 23 January 2014.\r\n\n\t- Restructuring proceedings under the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC are designed to rescue a financially deficit company from going bankrupt. The failure of restructuring will result in the bankruptcy of the company.\r\n\n\t- The last financial statement published by Qunxing on 26 August 2013 was the 2013 Interim Report which showed that the group made a net profit of RMB51.51 million. Its net assets increased to RMB3,268 million as at 30 June 2013. Its total liabilities amounted to only RMB163 million which were less than its cash balance of RMB655 million. Following the commencement of the proceedings under section 213 of the SFO, the SFC has located approximately $150 million held by the defendants in Hong Kong which is frozen by the interim order save for the sum of $13.31 million which the court has allowed them to withdraw for paying their operational expenses and legal fees.\r\n\n\t- Section 307B(1) of the SFO stipulates that a listed corporation must, as soon as reasonably practicable after any inside information has come to its knowledge, disclose the information to the public.","known_entities":"Best Known Group Limited|Qunxing Paper Holdings Company Limited|Best Known Group Limited|Qunxing Paper Holdings Company Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has suspended Mr Chan Chi Ki for six months from 1 April 2014 to 30 September 2014 (Note 1).\r\n\nThe disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation into Chan’s handling of a client’s accounts between December 2010 and November 2011.

At the material time, Chin is a substantial shareholder of Minth.\r\n\nSpecifically, the SFC alleges that:\r\n\n\t- The sellers in the acquisitions, Mr Hsu Chun Wei (nephew of Chin) and Ms Hsu Hsiao Ling (niece of Chin) were nominees of Chin and therefore not third parties independent of Minth. Chin was in fact the true beneficial owner of the issued shares in Magic Figure and Talentlink HK. A total of $99 million was paid by Decade for the purpose of the acquisitions and not RMB25.9 million as claimed in the Interim Report 2008 issued on 22 September 2008, and further that the bulk of the total consideration paid by Decade ended up in bank accounts controlled by Chin. Chin, therefore, acted in breach of his fiduciary duty owed to Decade and caused loss to Decade because of his material interests in the acquisitions. Chin also failed to disclose any of this to Minth, Decade and/or Minth’s board of directors.\r\n\n\t- Minth also falsely represented in its Interim Report 2008 that the sellers in the acquisitions were independent third parties and that the acquisitions resulted in a net cash inflow of RMB30 million.\r\n\n\t- Minth falsely represented in its announcement dated 12 June 2009 that the financial assistance to Mr Hsu and Ms Hsu given by Chin, which had been allegedly in place since 2007, was only ultimately repaid to Chin after the acquisitions had been completed by way of proceeds from completion of the acquisitions.\r\n\n\t- Minth failed to disclose in its circular to the shareholders dated 10 July 2009 to approve, confirm and ratify the acquisitions the true extent to which the consideration of the acquisitions ultimately went to the bank accounts controlled by Chin. Minth also failed to disclose in the circular a property loan made by the wife of Chin to Mr Hsu and Ms Hsu.\r\n\n\t- Shi, Zhao and Mu failed to make full and proper inquiries of Chin’s interests in the acquisitions, the true relationship and the financial assistance between Chin and Mr Hsu/Ms Hsu, and the manner in which the consideration was eventually disbursed, and failed to ensure Minth’s full compliance with the Listing Rules of SEHK.\r\n\nThe SFC is also seeking court orders that Chin pay $99 million compensation to Decade for loss or damage caused by his alleged misconduct.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Minth was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) on 1 December 2005.

It was later found that Tsang’s unauthorized trading and mis-marking activities, which had taken place over a three-year period, caused substantial losses to RBS totaling GBP24.4 million. Tsang concealed the losses by mis-marking her bond positions and booking, cancelling and amending fictitious bonds and futures trades in RBS’s internal systems.\r\n\nWhile Tsang’s misconduct is the primary cause of the losses to RBS, the SFC considers RBS’s risk management and controls over its Emerging Markets Rates Desk were deficient and failed to prevent misconduct like Tsang’s. In particular, the SFC investigation found:\r\n\n\t- inadequate and ineffective front office supervision; \r\n\n\t- an absence of controls over the process for independent price verification to mitigate the risk of inaccurate marking by traders of their positions, which had allowed Tsang to collude with RBS’s pricing sources to manipulate prices in her favour; \r\n\n\t- weak reconciliation process which Tsang exploited to conceal her unauthorized trading (Note 4); \r\n\n\t- RBS required traders to mark their positions to market value every day but when Tsang took leave in 2008, 2009 and 2010, her positions were not covered by anyone else resulting in her positions not being independently marked during these periods (Note 5);\r\n\n\t- the computerised system used by RBS to store block leave information failed to “lock out” Tsang from her RBS computer account and prevent her from accessing RBS applications while on block leave;\r\n\n\t- a lack of processes to monitor trades conducted outside RBS’s office and/or outside normal business hours via remote access i.e., a remote connection to RBS’s internal systems;\r\n\n\t- the management information provided to the front office for supervision purposes was unclear and/or inadequate making it difficult for supervisors to detect and question anomalies; and\r\n\n\t- there was no training provided to front office in relation to RBS’s front office supervisory policy and to employees who were promoted to supervisory roles as to their responsibilities which created inconsistent standards of supervision in the front office.\r\n\nRBS’s systems and controls in relation to its Emerging Markets Rates business were seriously inadequate and revealed significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\r\n\n\"RBS acted quickly in alerting the SFC on a Saturday afternoon which in turn led to action being taken that prevented Tsang from leaving Hong Kong. This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today’s sanctions are not heavier ones,\" said Mr Mark Steward, the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement. \"The SFC expects firms to report misconduct concerns immediately, as in this case.\"\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including RBS’s full co-operation with the SFC’s investigation, no loss to customers, RBS’s clean disciplinary record and its implementation of new governance structures, including front office supervision and new controls over operations, information technology, remote access, business unit control, group internal audit, compliance, block leave and trading books.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- RBS is a registered institution under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- RBS’s Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Asia Pacific (FICC APAC) operated a number of businesses in Asia Pacific which includes the Emerging Markets business. The Emerging Markets business was the second largest business in its FICC APAC and had four distinct trading desks, one of which was Rates.\r\n\n\t- On 30 August 2013, Tsang was convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to four years and two months’ imprisonment. Please see the Reasons for Sentence (DCCC326/2013) which is available on the Judiciary’s website (www.judiciary.gov.hk).\r\n\n\t- RBS extracted the relevant trading data for the reconciliation process from its systems at different points in time which created timing gaps. This was manipulated by Tsang to bypass the process. Tsang’s explanations concerning “breaks” identified in her books arising from the reconciliation process were accepted by RBS without adequate investigation or challenge.\r\n\n\t- RBS’s block leave policy required employees to take at least 14 consecutive calendar days of leave each year in a block (including public holidays). When on block leave, employees were prohibited from, among other things, effecting transactions, altering official bank records, conducting or influencing business critical activities via telephone or emails or remote access.

ICBCI Securities accepted the subscriptions of the Placees without conducting know-your-client due diligence as required under the Code of Conduct to either ascertain their financial situation or confirm their independence from Powerlong (Note 6).\r\n\nThe Offer Shares were subsequently re-priced due to insufficient demand. Upon the request of Powerlong, ICBCI Capital informed ICBCI Securities that extensive margin financing would have to be extended to particular Placees so that subscriptions under their accounts could be increased to prevent the listing from falling through.\r\n\nThereafter, subscriptions of these Placees suddenly increased by as much as tenfold. ICBCI Securities failed to perform ongoing scrutiny to ensure that the Placees’ subscriptions were consistent with its knowledge of their financial situation.\r\n\nIn light of the unusual and substantial increase in subscription sizes of these Placees, a certain staff member of ICBCI Capital voiced out his suspicion that the orders of these Placees belonged to Powerlong. However, no inquiry was made by ICBCI Capital to ascertain whether this was the case or the relationship between the Placees and Powerlong. Although the subscriptions of some of these Placees far exceeded their declared net worth, ICBCI Capital nevertheless allocated the Offer Shares to them. As a result, massive debit balances were triggered after the Offer Shares were booked into their accounts. Margin financing of as much as 50%, which was not generally granted in international primary placings, was then extended by ICBCI Securities to certain Placees.\r\n\nWhen some Placees raised questions regarding third-party settlement of their subscriptions, instead of questioning the reasons behind them, personnel of ICBCI Securities advised them to settle their allotment by various methods which ensured that the identity of the third-party depositors could not be traced.\r\n\nICBCI Securities filed the Marketing Statement (known as Form D) and a letter vouching placee independence with the SEHK even though it had not received all independence confirmations from the Placees at the time of making the filing with the SEHK in October 2009.

The court can order the person to comply with the SFC’s request if it is satisfied that the person does not have any reasonable excuse for not complying. This case concerned EY’s failure to comply with a total of five notices issued under section 183 of the SFO.\r\n\n\t- Standard Water applied for listing to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) on 9 November 2009.

On the same day, the SFC obtained an interim injunction freezing assets of up to $1,968,000,000.\r\n\nThe SFC has located approximately $150 million held by the defendants in Hong Kong which is frozen by the interim order. Qunxing and Best Known made an application for a variation of the interim injunction order for withdrawing money to pay their operational expenses and legal costs out of the funds that have been located in Hong Kong (Note 2).\r\n\nThe SFC opposed the application because Qunxing has other means of meeting its Hong Kong liabilities because its most recent interim consolidated financial reports show that the Qunxing group has cash and cash equivalents in the amount of RMB655,317,000, most of which is held by the defendants’ wholly-owned Mainland-based subsidiary, Shandong Qunxing. Past auditor’s reports in respect of Shandong Qunxing also show that it has undistributed profits in the amount of RMB1,301,939,950.02 (as at 31 December 2010), and it is both administratively and legally possible for Mainland funds held by a wholly-owned subsidiary to be remitted to Hong Kong to meet the defendants’ expenses.\r\n\nWhile taking this argument into account, the court exercised its discretion today to vary the interim injunction order to allow Qunxing and Best Known to withdraw about $4,410,000 for operational expenses (Note 3) and $6,600,000 for legal costs, covering the period until end of April 2014 (Note 4).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Please refer to the SFC’s press release dated 20 December 2013.\r\n\n\t- Before the hearing of the application, the court has varied the interim injunction order to allow Qunxing and Best Known to withdraw about $2,298,000 to meet certain operational expenses due in December 2013 and January 2014 and legal costs.\r\n\n\t- This amount includes $2.7 million for debts already owed by the defendants and $560,000 per month until the end of April 2014.\r\n\n\t- The court also permitted Qunxing to pay legal expenses of $1.5 million per month (it was seeking $2.125 million per month) and Best Known to pay legal expenses of $150,000 per month (it was seeking $300,000 per month) until the end of April 2014.","known_entities":"Best Known Group Limited|Qunxing Paper Holdings Company Limited|Best Known Group Limited|Qunxing Paper Holdings Company Limited"},{"article_body":"The Eastern Magistrates’ Court today convicted Mr Wong Pok Wang of 13 counts of manipulating the indicative equilibrium price (IEP) for eight derivative warrants and callable bull/bear contracts (CBBCs) during the Pre-opening Sessions between 15 October 2010 and 14 February 2011 (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nThe case is adjourned to 5 August 2014 for sentencing pending community service order report.\r\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) alleged that Wong created price ranges for the final IEP for the eight derivative warrants and CBBCs by placing high priced at-auction limit buy orders of small sizes (usually a single board lot) and low priced at-auction limit sell orders (of significant sizes) during the Order Input Period. Within five seconds before the close of the Pre-order Matching Period, he placed at-auction buy orders (of relatively large sizes) for the derivative warrants or CBBCs, pushing the final IEPs to the upper end of the price range by 9% to 39% on nine occasions. Wong sold the derivative warrants and CBBCs on a net basis at prices that were artificially high and profited from the trades (Notes 3 to 5).\r\n\nOn two occasions, Wong created price ranges during the Order Input Period in a similar manner, but he did not place any large at-auction buy orders just before the close of the Pre-order Matching Period because there were no auction buy orders from other investors in the market to whom Wong could sell the derivative warrants or CBBCs. In other words, there was no need for Wong to raise the final IEP.\r\n\nOn another occasion, Wong placed a high priced at-auction limit buy order but did not place any other order during the Pre-opening Session. Subsequently, Wong inputted a matching sell order to fill the buy order when the market opened, and this resulted in a wash trade at an artificial high price (Note 6).\r\n\nThe SFC alleged that Wong’s order placing activities made no economic sense and he obtained illicit gains of $16,320 from his manipulative trades in the derivative warrants and CBBCs.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n1.  Wong was licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities. He was accredited to Mayfair Pacific Financial Group Limited between 7 January 2011 and 15 April 2011. Wong is currently not licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission.\r\n\n2.  An IEP is the price during the Pre-opening Sessions at which the maximum number of shares could be traded if order matching occurred at that time. An IEP is calculated and determined by the orders inputted by investors during the Pre-opening Sessions.\r\n\n3.  At the material times, the Pre-opening Sessions commenced at 9:30 am on each trading day and comprised four periods:\r\n\n(i) Order Input Period (9:30 am to 9:45 am) during which only at-auction orders and at-auction limit orders are accepted, modified or cancelled; \n\n(ii) Pre-order Matching Period (9:45 am to 9:50 am) during which only at-auctions orders are accepted and no existing order can be modified or cancelled; \n\n(iii) Order Matching Period (9:50 am to 9:58 am) during which no input, modification or cancellation of orders are allowed and orders are matched at the IEP; and\n\n(iv) Blocking Period (9:58 am to 10:00 am) during which no matching would take place.\r\n\n4.  An at-auction order is an order with no specified price and is entered into the trading system for execution at the final IEP. An at-auction limit order on the other hand is an order with a specified price. An at-auction order enjoys higher order matching priority than an at-auction limit order and will be matched in time priority at the final IEP. An at-auction limit buy order with a specified price at or higher than the final IEP may be matched at the final IEP subject to availability of eligible matching order on the sell side. Similarly, an at-auction limit sell order with a specified price at or lower than the final IEP may be matched at the final IEP subject to availability of eligible matching order on buy side.\r\n\n5.  The derivative warrants and CBBCs were :\r\n\n(i)   MB-CMB@EC1012 (Stock Code 22449)\n\n(ii)   CS-CMB@EC1012B (Stock Code 24378)\n\n(iii)  CT-L&F@EC1101 (Stock Code 21659)\n\n(iv)  MB-SHK P@EC1102 (Stock Code 23687)\n\n(v)   SG#HWL RC1105B (Stock Code 65733)\n\n(vi)  SG-CK(H)@EC1102B (Stock Code 24420)\n\n(vii)  JP#HSI RP1102Q (Stock Code 65995)\n\n(viii) BP-CK(H)@EC1103 (Stock Code 24990)\r\n\n6.  Wash sales are transactions that do not involve any change in beneficial ownership.","known_entities":"WONG Pok Wang|Pok Wang WONG"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has revoked the licences of Union Securities Limited (Union Securities) and its two responsible officers, Mr Ma Kin Chung and Ms Cheng Tai Ha.  Ma and Cheng have also been prohibited from re-entering the industry for life (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nAn SFC investigation found that Union Securities, with the involvement of Ma and Cheng, misappropriated approximately $400,000 from two clients who thought they were depositing those moneys for settlement of orders. \r\n\nUnder the term of its licence, Union Securities was prohibited from holding client assets and was required to place all orders with an execution broker.  The funds were deposited into an account controlled by Ma in the name of Union Securities’ predecessor which Ma had represented to the SFC to have been ceased to be used.

Morgan Securities (Far East) Limited (JPMSFE) (collectively “JP Morgan”), and fined them $15 million, $12 million and $3 million respectively for various regulatory breaches and/or internal control failings (Notes 1 to 3).\r\n\nAn SFC investigation revealed that JP Morgan had failed to implement adequate systems and controls in its institutional equities business in Hong Kong to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to the following areas:\r\n\n\t- short selling activities;\r\n\n\t- client facilitation and principal trading business; and\r\n\n\t- operation of dark liquidity pool trading services.\r\n\nShort selling activities\r\n\nBetween May 2010 and February 2013, JPMBHK and JPMSAP had incorrectly aggregated the inventory positions controlled by a principal trading desk across two offshore affiliates in determining whether their position in a security is net long or net short.  As a consequence, the two firms wrongly conducted over 41,000 uncovered short sale trades as long sale trades (Notes 4 & 5).\r\n\nFurthermore, contrary to the requirements under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), 34% of the short selling orders placed by JPMBHK and/or JPMSAP for their principal trading in May 2012 did not have the appropriate “documentary assurance” in place to confirm that the sales were covered when the short sell orders were placed (Note 6).\r\n\nClient facilitation and principal trading business\r\n\nA review by the SFC found that, between January 2011 and December 2012, JPMSFE and JPMSAP did not have adequate systems and controls in place to prevent a client facilitation trade being executed without the client’s consent. \r\n\nThe SFC also found that JP Morgan granted seven facilitation traders and 14 principal traders incorrect access rights under its network shared drives and/or order management systems between January and December 2012.  As a result, the facilitation and principal traders were able to view client order flow information beyond their defined access rights.\r\n\nFurthermore, JP Morgan had set up a reporting structure with potential conflicts under which the trading desks responsible for handling agency orders had a reporting line to two senior managers who were also facilitation traders prior to August 2012.  However, JP Morgan did not put in place effective systems and controls to guard against potential misuse or abuse of client agency order flow information by the facilitation traders.\r\n\nOperation of dark liquidity pool trading services\r\n\nIn April 2011, the SFC granted approval to JPMBHK to carry on business in Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regulated activity.  During and after the application process, JPMBHK represented to the SFC that its client-facing crossing engine, namely JPMX, was a pure agency-to-agency matching platform.\r\n\nThe SFC however found that numerous principal orders of JP Morgan were incorrectly routed into the agency pool of JPMX for matching between March and July 2012 due to human and systems errors.  None of these orders were crossed in JPMX.  There were also a number of instances where agency orders were incorrectly routed on two dates in August and December 2012 into a separate, non-client principal pool of JPMX.  Some of these agency orders were crossed with principal orders in this separate pool but none of them were executed at a price lower than the prevailing best bid (for sell orders) or higher than the prevailing best ask (for buy orders) price of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\r\n\nMany of the above failings were not identified or corrected until the SFC brought them to JP Morgan’s attention in the course of a SFC inspection into the business activities of JPMBHK and JPMSFE.\r\n\nIn determining this disciplinary action, the SFC took into account that JP Morgan:\r\n\n\t- co-operated with the SFC in resolving the SFC’s concerns;\r\n\n\t- has taken steps to rectify the concerns raised by the SFC;\r\n\n\t- agreed to engage an independent reviewer to conduct a forward-looking review of the internal controls and systems of JP Morgan in respect of the areas mentioned above;

and (b) where the securities have been borrowed to cover the sale, that the lender has the securities available to lend to the seller.  Section 171(3) of the SFO also provides that where an Exchange Participant conducts a short selling order as a principal, and if the “cover” for the sale is a borrowing arrangement, the Exchange Participants must have obtained a documentary assurance from the lender that the lender has the securities available to lend to him before conveying the orders to SEHK.","known_entities":"J.P.

About 98% of the funds were passed on to its purported customers and eventually circulated back to Central Steel Macao through a multitude of bank accounts, all through multiple entities set up around the world yet controlled centrally within China Metal Recycling.\r\n\nThere was no sign of the scheme terminating or at least curtailing in scale after the IPO, or even after the SFC has started investigating into the matter. Quite the contrary, the fictitious circulation of funds increased both in terms of the amounts and its complexity.\r\n\nThe former management of the company and its subsidiaries prior to the appointment of the provisional liquidators denied any impropriety and, until recently, opposed the SFC’s case. However, without accepting any liability, the former management withdrew from the case and took no part in the hearing.\r\n\nAfter considering the SFC’s evidence, the Hon Mr Justice Harris today granted the order to wind up China Metal Recycling (Note 5).\r\n\n\"This is an audacious and dishonest scheme using multiple secret nominees established all around the world to deceive Hong Kong investors and creditors into believing this company had a track record and a performance that it simply did not have. It has been stopped and control will vest with independent, court appointed liquidators. The liquidators will be able to conduct an independent assessment of the company’s real position, in the best interests of all those with a financial interest in the case,\" the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Mark Steward said.\r\n\n\"This has been a very challenging investigation, an unparalleled dogged pursuit to uproot this misconduct in as many parts of the world as the company falsely claimed its containers had travelled. The SFC will continue this pursuit to combat corporate misconduct like this and there is no doubt our work in this matter is not finished yet,\" he added.\r\n\nThe SFC would like to acknowledge and thank the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Netherlands Authority of the Financial Markets and the Monetary Authority of Macao for their assistance in the investigation of this case.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- China Metal Recycling was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on 18 July 2007. On 10 June 2009, it issued a Prospectus for Global Offering. On 22 June 2009, its shares were listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.

Section 212 of the SFO permits the SFC to apply for a winding-up order against companies if it appears to the SFC that it is desirable in the public interest to do so, and the Court may grant the order on the ground that it is just and equitable to wind up those companies.\r\n\n\t- The SFC investigated a total of approximately 1,042 bills of lading purportedly issued between 2007 and 2013.

The SFC found that:\r\n\n\t- BIX did not operate as represented in materials provided to clients. In effect, BNPP Securities Asia represented that orders would be executed in accordance with order price priority, e.g. a buy order with higher price would have priority over a buy order with a lower price. In reality , BIX failed to give priority to higher priced orders and treated all orders as having equal priority with allocations on a pro rata basis between November 2009 and April 2011. This potentially affected all BIX auctions with two or more orders at different order prices and did affect some BIX auctions (Note 2);\r\n\n\t- BNPP Securities Asia suspended BIX services in April 2011 upon the discovery that order matching was not conducted according to order price priority. BIX services were not fully restored until seven months later and the SFC was not informed of the suspension until 21 months later in January 2013. This constitutes a breach of BNPP Securities Asia’s licensing condition (Note 3);\r\n\n\t- BNPP Securities Asia’s business plan for its licence application for providing automated trading services stated that client consent would be obtained before their orders were placed to the BIX for matching. However, client orders intended for execution on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong were automatically enabled on the BIX without BNPP Securities Asia seeking positive client consent. The SFC was not notified about the change of BNPP Securities Asia’s business plan as required (Note 4); and\r\n\n\t- BNPP Securities Asia failed to: (i) maintain sufficient trade records relating to BIX that identified the specific auction in which each order participated; and (ii) coherently document the matching logic, to explain the matched trades. This means it is difficult to calculate the precise impact of the failure to implement a trade execution process where order priority is based on price (Note 5).  \r\n\nMr Mark Steward, the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, said “No one should dive into dark water without knowing what is hidden.

From 1 April 2012, it was superseded by the “Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing” and the “Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Guideline” issued by the SFC. \r\n\n\t- Licensed corporations should have proper systems and controls in place for the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions. The first and foremost step is to gain sufficient knowledge about a customer’s business and financial circumstances (through customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring) to recognise that a transaction, or a series of transactions, is unusual. There should also be procedures in place for reporting internally by escalation to senior management and reporting externally to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit.","known_entities":"SHAM Sze Wai, Miranda|Sze Wai SHAM|Miranda SHAM|Miranda Sze Wai SHAM"},{"article_body":"Court appointed administrators, Mr John Lees and Mr Mat Ng of JLA Asia Limited, have completed distributions of restoration payments to all but three of the 297 counterparties to the insider dealing by convicted insider trader Mr Du Jun (Note 1).\r\n\nA total of $23,086,314 out of the restoration fund has been paid out.

four former senior executives (including its former financial controller) disclosed false or misleading information inducing transactions and so engaged in market misconduct under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) following proceedings brought by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) (Notes 1, 2 and 3).\r\n\nThe four ex-Greencool senior executives are former directors, Mr Zhang Xihan, Mr Hu Xiaohui, and Mr Xu Wanping, and former financial controller, Mr Henry Mok Wing Kai.  Mok was also a qualified accountant appointed under the GEM Listing Rules and the company secretary of Greencool.\r\n\nThe SFC alleged that Gu and former senior executives of Greencool were involved in grossly overstating the company’s net asset value in its annual reports and results announcements released between 2001 and 2005 as a result of the overstatement of bank deposits and the non-disclosure of bank loans.\r\n\nThe MMT found that Gu, with the assistance of Zhang and Hu, had perpetrated a massive, systemic fraud and the fraud was known to Xu and several employees at Mainland subsidiaries who were ordered to participate in it. \r\n\nGu, Zhang and Hu were involved in gross overstatements of Greencool’s sales, profit, trade receivables and bank deposits, overstating the company’s net asset value for the financial years ended 31 December 2000 to 2004 by approximately RMB487 million, RMB653 million, RMB982 million, RMB1,062 million and RMB904 million respectively which represents 43% to 80% of Greencool’s total net assets in these years.\r\n\nMok, a qualified accountant/company secretary, was found culpable of market misconduct by providing materially false or misleading information to the public in circumstances in which he was negligent as to whether the information was false or misleading.  He was negligent in performing his professional duties as a qualified accountant by failing to supervise the implementation of a sound internal control and financial reporting system, thereby enabling Gu, Zhang and Hu to provide false and misleading annual results of Greencool from 2001 to 2005 to defraud the investing public. \r\n\nThe MMT notes that although the responsibilities of a qualified accountant pursuant to Rule 5.11 of the GEM Listing Rules (Rule) is broad in nature and it only sets out the minimum responsibilities, the description of the Rule “does not limit the role of a qualified accountant to that of an adviser; a qualified accountant is to advise and assist the board of directors, that is, to take such steps as may be necessary to implement internal controls and other procedures that are necessary to provide the board with a reasonable basis for making sound commercial judgments” and such duties are “not limited to that of a holding company but extend to taking such steps as may be necessary to implement internal controls and other procedures in all the companies making up ‘the Group’”.\r\n\nThe SFC also commenced proceedings under section 213 of the SFO against Gu in the Court of First Instance in parallel with the MMT proceedings.  The SFC successfully obtained an injunction on 18 July 2014 to

and (b) confirmed that they and their clients have waived the benefit of any law which prohibited the provision of ultimate client information to the Regulators.\r\n\n\t- The Client Identity Rule Policy stipulates that a licensed person must refuse the business of those who are not prepared to provide client identity information to the Regulators upon request (paragraph 23).  The Client Identity Rule also stipulates that if a licensed person has been put on notice that some intermediary in the chain of intermediaries involved in a transaction might not comply with its agreement in relation to that transaction so that the licensed person could no longer be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the information would be available to the Regulators on request and continued to deal with that intermediary, the SFC would consider taking disciplinary action against the licensed person (paragraph 27).","known_entities":"Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited|Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited"},{"article_body":"The Court of First Instance today found that two solicitors, Mr Eric Lee Kwok Wa and Ms Betty Young Bik Fung, and Eric Lee’s sister, Ms Patsy Lee Siu Ying, contravened the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) by insider dealing in the shares of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings Ltd (Asia Satellite) and engaged in fraud or deception in transactions involving securities of Hsinchu International Bank Company Ltd (Hsinchu Bank) (Note 1).\r\n\nThe court’s decision is a landmark ruling on the interpretation of section 300 of the SFO which prohibits the use of fraudulent or deceptive schemes in transactions involving securities.\r\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started civil proceedings in the court against Eric Lee, Betty Young, Patsy Lee and Ms Stella Lee, both sisters of Eric Lee, in December 2010 under section 213 of the SFO and alleged the defendants made a total profit of $2.9 million in these transactions.\r\n\nThe SFC alleged that, in relation to Hsinchu Bank transactions in September 2006:\r\n\n\t- Betty Young obtained information about a tender offer for Hsinchu Bank shares while working as a lawyer seconded to a client of her employing law firm;\r\n\n\t- the client she was seconded to intended to make the tender offer and she was working on the offer (Note 2);\r\n\n\t- the information about the offer was non-public, confidential and materially price sensitive;\r\n\n\t- subsequently, Betty Young bought Hsinchu Bank shares and tipped off Eric Lee and his sisters to buy the shares before the announcement of the tender offer; and\r\n\n\t- this amounted to fraud or deception under section 300 of the SFO because Betty Young owed duties to her employer and their client including the duty to refrain from using such information for personal gain.\r\n\nThe SFC further alleged that, in relation to Asia Satellite transactions in February 2007:\r\n\n\t- Eric Lee obtained information about the proposed privatization of Asia Satellite shares when the law firm he worked for advised on this transaction;\r\n\n\t- that information was non-public, confidential and materially price sensitive;\r\n\n\t- subsequently Eric Lee tipped off Betty Young and his sisters to buy Asia Satellite shares before the announcement of the proposed privatization (Note 3); and\r\n\n\t- this amounted to insider dealing under section 291 of the SFO.\r\n\nThe court found that these allegations were proven against Betty Young, Eric Lee and Patsy Lee.\r\n\nThe court ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove the allegations against Stella Lee. Nevertheless, the court may exercise its power under section 213 of the SFO against her to remove the illicit profit from her and restore the victims in the transactions. The court may make orders under section 213 against people who are knowingly or otherwise involved in a contravention of the SFO.\r\n\nThe SFC and the defendants are directed to jointly work out the precise terms of the final orders in view of the judgment.\r\n\nThe court also directed that a copy of the judgement be sent to the Law Society of Hong Kong because Eric Lee and Betty Young are both member of the Law Society (Note 4).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Hsinchu Bank was a listed company on the Stock Exchange of Taiwan in September 2006 and Asia Satellite was a listed company on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in February 2007.\r\n\n\t- On 29 September 2006, Standard Chartered Bank announced the tender offer for Hsinchu Bank shares at NT$24.50 per share which was around a 40% premium over the last closing price for Hsinchu Bank shares.\r\n\n\t- On 14 February 2007, the proposed privatization of Asia Satellite shares was announced and the offer price was $18.30, which was around a 30% premium over the last closing price for Asia Satellite shares.\r\n\n\t- Betty Young and Eric Lee were employed, at the relevant time, as solicitors by Slaughter & May and Linklaters respectively.

Each of these orders was placed at a price higher than CNFM’s nominal price and the orders matched exactly with the prevailing best ask price and quantity such that they were executed as soon as they were entered into the market.\r\n\nAs a result, the share price of CNFM was artificially raised by 37.3 per cent from $0.075 to $0.103.\r\n\nAt around the same time, Wong carried out a cross-trade to transfer about 5 million CNFM shares at the price of $0.105 from the personal account of another client (Client B) to a joint account held by Client B and his wife (the Joint Account).\r\n\nThe SFC found that Wong’s purpose in pushing up the share price of CNFM (through the trades in Client A’s account) was to facilitate the subsequent cross-trade between Client B’s personal account and the Joint Account at a higher price to eliminate the debit cash balance in Client B’s personal account (Note 2).\r\n\nThe SFC considers that Wong’s conduct was not only unfair to Client A, but was also unfair to other investors because it interfered with the impartiality and objectivity of the normal process of price formation, and might have affected the trading strategy and investment decision of other market participants (Note 3).\r\n\nIn deciding the penalty, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including that:\r\n\n\t- Wong’s conduct has caused financial loss to Client A;\r\n\n\t- a strong message needs to be sent to the market that Wong’s conduct is unfair and could jeopardise market integrity and undermine market confidence;\r\n\n\t- Wong, who has been in the securities industry for about 15 years, should have known that the manner in which he placed the orders could have the effect of artificially raising the nominal price of the shares; and\r\n\n\t- Wong has no previous disciplinary record.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Wong was licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities.

guarantee in favour of Hanergy in respect of the amount owed by Hanergy Holding and/or its affiliates.  Hanergy Option Limited, a company wholly-owned by Li, has also executed a share charge in respect of 1,367,000,000 shares of Hanergy in favour of Hanergy to secure the obligation of Li under the deed of guarantee.  As a result of the execution of the deed of guarantee and the share charge, the SFC no longer needs to seek a Court order requiring Li to execute a deed of guarantee. \r\n\n\t- The disqualification orders made against Li, Zhao, Wang Tongbo, Xu and Wang Wenjing became effective on 4 September 2017.\r\n\n\t- Hanergy Holding repaid the loan fully by June 2014.\r\n\n\t- The SFC suspended the trading in the shares of Hanergy under section 8 of the Securities and Futures (Stock Market Listing) Rules (SMLR).  Under section 9 of the SMLR, a listed company, whose shares have been suspended by the SFC under section 8 of SMLR for trading, may make representations to the SFC.  Upon such representations, the SFC may permit trading to resume subject to conditions or cancel the listing.  The powers of the SFC under section 9 of SMLR may only be exercised by a meeting of the SFC and are not delegable.","known_entities":"LI He Jun|WANG Tongbo|WANG Wenjing|XU Zheng|ZHAO Lan|Tongbo WANG|Wenjing WANG|He Jun LI|Lan ZHAO|Zheng XU"},{"article_body":"The Securities

non-executive directors, Ms Zhao Lan, Mr Wang Tongbo, Mr Xu Zheng and Mr Wang Wenjing, of Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Limited (Hanergy) (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nThe SFC is also seeking a court order requiring Li to procure that Hanergy’s parent company, Hanergy Holding Group Limited (Hanergy Holding) and/or its affiliates pay all outstanding receivables due to Hanergy under various sales contracts and execute a guarantee securing their payment. The first hearing of the petition will be in the Court of First Instance on 31 May 2017.\r\n\nThe SFC’s action follows its investigation into various very substantial connected transactions between Hanergy and Hanergy Holding since 2010 (Note 3).\r\n\nThe SFC alleges that the five directors failed to question the viability of Hanergy’s business model which relied on the sales of solar panel production systems to its connected parties, Hanergy Holding and its affiliates, as its main source of revenue; and failed to properly assess the financial positions of the connected parties and hence the recoverability of the receivables due from them as a result of these connected transactions.\r\n\nThey also failed to take proper steps to recover these receivables by putting the interests of the connected parties before that of Hanergy, and so did not act in Hanergy’s best interest.\r\n\nOn 15 July 2015, the SFC suspended trading in the shares of Hanergy.  The trading suspension remains in place (Note 4).\r\n\nHanergy has indicated its intention to seek a resumption of the trading in its shares.  The SFC has stipulated two requirements for a resumption:\r\n\n\t- that the five directors agree not to contest the legal proceedings and the SFC’s application to disqualify them and that Li also agrees not to contest the SFC’s application for a court order requiring him to procure and guarantee payment of receivables;

Instance (CFI) which had ruled in favour of an insider dealing and fraud case brought by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) against two solicitors – Ms Betty Young Bik Fung and Mr Eric Lee Kwok Wa – and Lee’s two sisters. \r\n\nOn 15 January 2016, the CFI found Young, Lee and his sister Ms Patsy Lee Siu Ying contravened the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) by insider dealing in the shares of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings Ltd and section 300 of the SFO (section 300) by engaging in fraud or deception in transactions involving the shares of Taiwan-listed Hsinchu International Bank Company Ltd (Hsinchu Bank) (Note 1).\r\n\nThe CFI also made restoration orders against Lee’s other sister, Ms Stella Lee Siu Fan, under section 213 of the SFO in respect of the same transactions. \r\n\nIn February 2016, all four defendants appealed against the CFI’s decision, but Young withdrew her appeal shortly before the September 2017 hearing in the Court of Appeal. \r\n\nThe trio argued in their appeal that:\r\n\n\t- The CFI failed to properly consider the evidence they adduced at the trial;\r\n\n\t- Section 300 was not applicable to their conduct in relation to the Hsinchu Bank shares because (i) the Hong Kong courts have no jurisdiction over trading activities carried out on the Taiwanese Stock Exchange; (ii) the supposed victims of their alleged fraudulent activities were not counterparties to their trades conducted on the Taiwanese Stock Exchange; and (iii) the alleged fraudulent or deceptive activities and the trading activities were not sufficiently related to form the elements of section 300.\r\n\nThe Court of Appeal disagreed and held that:\r\n\n\t- The CFI did properly consider the defendants’ evidence and draw proper inferences;\r\n\n\t- Hong Kong courts had jurisdiction to hear this case because a substantial measure of activities constituting the contravention took place in Hong Kong; \r\n\n\t- The application of section 300 would not be limited to a case in which the counterparties in the securities transaction were the victims of the fraud; and\r\n\n\t- Although the fraud was not directed at the counterparties to the subsequent trading activities on the Taiwanese Stock Exchange, the fraud or deception and the subsequent trading activities were sufficiently related (i.e. there was a real and substantial nexus) to form the elements of section 300.\r\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Thomas Atkinson, said: “We welcome the Court of Appeal’s judgment clarifying the interpretation of section 300.  The SFC will vigorously pursue enforcement actions to combat violation of the SFO when a substantial measure of activities designed to breach the SFO occur in our jurisdiction even if it involves securities traded on exchanges outside Hong Kong”.\r\n\nLawyers for Stella Lee argued that she should not be ordered to restore her counterparties since she was found not to have participated in the insider dealing.  But the Court of Appeal upheld the restoration order against her because (i) there is no assertion that the making of the order will prejudice her beyond removing the profits made; and (ii) her investment decisions were prompted or influenced by the disclosure to her of information that was based on the inside information even though she was unaware of that. \r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNote:\r\n\n\t-

fined a record sum of HK$400 million after the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal (SFAT) upheld the SFC’s disciplinary action against the bank for material systemic failures in relation to the sale of derivative products – namely, Lehman Brothers-related Notes (LB-Notes) and Leveraged Forward Accumulators (FAs) – in the run-up to the global financial crisis in 2008 (Notes 1 to 4).\r\n\nHSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s registration for Type 4 regulated activity (advising on securities) has been suspended for a period of one year and its registration for Type 1 regulated activity (dealing in securities) has also been partially suspended under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) for a period of one year (Note 5).\r\n\nThe SFAT said in its determination that the SFC was correct in its findings and concluded that the bank was culpable of material systemic failings in its marketing and sale of derivative products by falling short of the standards set out in the SFC Code of Conduct and ancillary guidelines. The bank’s culpability was “extensive, putting many clients at unnecessary risk of loss and indeed resulting in substantial losses for many,” it added (Notes 6 & 7).  \r\n\nBetween January 2003 and December 2008, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s internal processes were found to be materially flawed in:\r\n\n\t- understanding each client’s true risk profile;\r\n\n\t- ensuring the suitability of products for each client; and\r\n\n\t- supervising and monitoring sales processes in order to detect and avoid risk mismatch.\r\n\nThe SFAT is of the view that a fine of HK$400 million is appropriate and recognises that “it is also exemplary in that for the greater protection of the integrity of Hong Kong’s financial markets, it provides a stern warning that principles of professional conduct must be adhered to”.\r\n\n\"Put another way, that – in future – penalties imposed for convenient avoidance of the requirements of the Code of Conduct will constitute something more severe than the mere ‘cost of doing business’,” the SFAT added.    \r\n\nMr Ashley Alder, the SFC’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s systems and controls for selling structured products fell significantly short of the standards expected of them. In combination with flawed practices and intrinsically high risk products, the bank’s failures magnified the risk and occurrence of significant losses for customers. Accordingly, we have decided very substantial sanctions are required.”\r\n\n\"The message should be clear: our standards are designed to protect all investors including clients of retail or private banks.  When breaches of these standards occur, the SFC will take action to enforce them and strive to achieve outcomes that are in the interest of the investing public,” he added.\r\n\nLehman Brothers-related Notes\r\n\nBy the summer of 2008, the financial crisis was increasingly alarming.  HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA was aware of the deteriorating financial condition and credit quality of Lehman Brothers and had itself materially reduced its exposure to Lehman Brothers (Note 8).  Nevertheless, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA continued to sell the LB-Notes to its clients until 3 September 2008, i.e. two weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and did not disclose to its clients that the LB-Notes were issued by Lehman Brothers nor warned its clients about the increasing credit risk of the LB-Notes during the sales process (Notes 9, 10 & 11).\r\n\nIt was also found that in over 80 per cent of the outstanding LB-Notes transactions, there was a mismatch between the client’s risk tolerance level and the risk rating assigned by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA to the relevant LB-Notes, with clients who were categorised with “low” or “medium” risk tolerance levels purchasing LB-Notes rated the riskiest by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA.  HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA did not keep adequate or proper records of justification for these risk-mismatch transactions (Notes 12, 13 & 14).\r\n\nLeveraged Forward Accumulators\r\n\nIn distributing FAs to clients between January 2003 and December 2008, the SFC found that HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA failed to implement adequate systems and controls to prevent clients from being overly exposed to FAs and to ensure that clients had sufficient financial resources to assume the risks of trading in FAs even though FAs were at the time assigned internally the highest risk rating. \r\n\nUnder HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s own in-house policy during the relevant period, a client should not be advised to invest more than 10 per cent of his/her portfolio held with the bank in any single structured product, or more than 5 per cent of the portfolio if the investment was considered to be high risk.  However, the SFC’s investigation revealed that HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA had dis-applied this policy in the sale of FAs despite being considered as a high risk product by the bank.  HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA did not substitute this in-house policy with any other suitable policy to prevent clients from being overly exposed to FAs and to ensure that clients had sufficient financial resources to bear the potential losses of trading in FAs at the time of entering into the trade.\r\n\nThis case was referred to the SFC by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) following its investigation into issues arising from numerous complaints. The SFC acknowledges the investigatory work and assistance provided by the HKMA.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA is a registered institution under the SFO to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- The LB-Notes, including callable daily accrual notes (CDAs) and equity-linked notes (ELNs), were issued by Lehman Brothers Treasury Co.

The gross revenue generated from these transactions was about HK$2.19 billion.\r\n\n\t- In relation to the partial suspension of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s registration for Type 1 regulated activity (dealing in securities) under the SFO, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA is allowed only to handle trading in listed securities for clients and to provide advice to clients incidental to such trading.\r\n\n\t- In the SFC’s decision, it was decided that (i) HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s registration for Type 4 regulated activity (advising on securities) be revoked and its registration for Type 1 regulated activity (dealing in securities) be partially revoked to the extent that the bank would only be allowed to handle trading in listed securities for clients and to provide advice to clients incidental to such trading; and (ii) HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA be fined HK$605 million.  Taking into account, among other things, that HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s failings were not shown to be dishonest, intentional or reckless and that steps were taken by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA from time to time to improve its systems, the SFAT determined that an appropriate period of suspension, in lieu of a revocation of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s registration, would have a better effect.  In respect of the level of fine, the SFAT has treated the four areas of misconduct in relation to the sale of FAs as alleged by the SFC as one single category of “failure to ensure suitability of product” and reduced the fine to HK$400 million\r\n\n\t- Please refer to the SFAT’s Reasons for Determination, which is available on its website at www.sfat.gov.hk\n\n\r\n\n\t- On 31 July 2008, as a preventive measure, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA’s head office in Geneva gave a directive that there should be a review of credit exposure to Lehman Brothers.  As a result, on 12 August 2008, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA reduced its broking limits for Lehman Brothers in relation to bonds, CDAs and ELNs from US$2 million to US$1 million\r\n\n\t- A total of 672 LB-Note transactions were outstanding as at 15 September 2008. The outstanding LB-Notes are held by over 540 customers and involve a total nominal value of approximately HK$2.33 billion\r\n\n\t- Based on the records provided by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, 59 transactions in LB-Notes, involving a total nominal amount of HK$338.3 million, were executed after 1 January 2008.  Of these transactions, 42 were executed after 1 June 2008\r\n\n\t- From a review of the tape recordings provided by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA in relation to 16 transactions executed between July and August 2008, the SFC found that the sales staff did not disclose to the clients that the LB-Notes were issued by Lehman Brothers or alert the clients to the increasing credit risk associated with the LB-Notes during the sales process. \r\n\n\t-  At the relevant time, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA adopted a 5-level classification of product risk rating (1-minimal, 2-low, 3-moderate, 4-medium, 5-high).  CDAs and ELNs issued by Lehman Brothers were assigned the highest risk rating of “5” and the second highest risk rating of “4” respectively by HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA\r\n\n\t- Before April 2008, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA divided its client’s risk tolerance into three levels, i.e. “low”, “medium” and “high”. \r\n\n\t- A risk-mismatch in this case refers to a client of “low” or “medium” risk tolerance level purchasing a product with the highest risk rating of “5”.","known_entities":"HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA|HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has banned Mr Ma Yu Lung, a former representative of Sun Hung Kai Investment Services Limited (SHKIS), from re-entering the industry for eight years from 26 January 2017 to 25 January 2025 for breach of the Code of Conduct (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation found that on numerous occasions between September 2009 and February 2010, Ma:\r\n\n\t- accepted order instructions from unknown and unauthorized individuals to trade securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and colluded with SHKIS’ account holders to pretend the order instructions originated from them when this was not the case; \r\n\n\t- allowed execution of trades flowing from these order instructions in the securities trading accounts of others at SHKIS;

controls for handling payments from client accounts to third parties were deficient and inadequate. GSL failed to demonstrate that it had conducted appropriate enquiries before processing third party payments. Moreover, the enquiries it claimed to have made at the time, and the rationale for approving the payments, were not properly documented in writing (Note 2).\r\n\nSpecifically, the SFC’s investigations revealed that:\r\n\n\t- only about 570 application forms out of approximately 700 payments from client accounts to third parties were found;\r\n\n\t- among these 570 payments accompanied with application forms, the relationship between the client and the third party and/or the purpose of one-third of these payments was not, or could not be verified; only about 67 were supported with proper documentation;\r\n\n\t- the application forms offered little information of the relationship between the client accounts and the third parties as well as the purpose of the payments but staff as well as management proceeded to approve such payments; and\r\n\n\t- the third party payments involved millions and in one case up to over $39 million.\r\n\nThe SFC is of the view that GSL’s conduct was in breach of the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Guidance Note, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing, and the Code of Conduct, which require licensed corporations to:\r\n\n\t- pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose.

and\r\n\n\t- whether the Connected Guarantees would continue, and if so, how would China Huinong manage the conflicts of interests between itself and the Connected Guarantors.\r\n\nBy failing to conduct reasonable due diligence on issues related to the Connected Guarantees, BIAL breached the Code of Conduct, under which BIAL as a sponsor should have:\r\n\n\t- performed all reasonable due diligence on China Huinong before submitting a listing application on its behalf; and\r\n\n\t- done more due diligence to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information provided by China Huinong, after it becomes aware of circumstances that cast doubt on the information provided to it or otherwise indicated a potential problem or risk (Notes 4 & 5).\r\n\nFailure to ensure that all material information has been included in the Application Proof\r\n\nThe Connected Guarantees were not disclosed in the Application Proof submitted to the SEHK.  As a result, the SEHK returned China Huinong’s listing application on the ground that the disclosure of information in the Application Proof was not complete in all material respects to enable a reasonable investor to make a fully-informed investment decision (Note 6).\r\n\nThe SFC also found that the Connected Guarantees raised material issues relating to China Huinong’s business model, its internal controls to manage conflicts; and whether the Connected Guarantees should have been considered as connected transactions.  In the absence of reasonable due diligence on these issues, BIAL was not in a position to assess the materiality of the Connected Guarantees to the operation of China Huinong and to ensure that all material information in relation to China Huinong has been included in the Application Proof in breach of the Code of Conduct (Notes 7 & 8).\r\n\nFailure to ensure that all information provided to the regulators is accurate and not misleading\r\n\nDuring the listing application, the SEHK and the SFC asked about the independence of the persons who guaranteed the loan advanced by China Huinong.  Due to negligence on the part of BIAL’s transaction team, BIAL initially did not disclose the existence of the Connected Guarantees or that parties related to China Huinong had guaranteed its short-term loans, but only did so until after rounds of queries from the SEHK/SFC.\r\n\nThe SFC found that BIAL breached the Code of Conduct by failing to ensure that all information provided to the SEHK and the SFC is accurate and not misleading in any material respect (Note 9).\r\n\nSponsors play a crucial role in the Hong Kong stock market being responsible for assessing the listing suitability of a company to be listed and verifying the information disclosed in the prospectus.  The SFC and the investing public expect sponsors to examine information provided by the listing applicants with professional scepticism and ensure that the draft listing documents contain relevant and meaningful disclosure about the listing applicants.  Sponsors who fail to fulfil these requirements will face tough sanctions, even if the listing application is eventually withdrawn or returned by the SEHK.\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- BIAL cooperated with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary action and not disputing the SFC’s findings and regulatory concerns;\r\n\n\t- there is no evidence to suggest a systemic failure in BIAL’s policies, procedures and practices relating to its sponsorship work;   \r\n\n\t- the senior management of BIAL agreed to review and enhance its policies, procedures and practices relating to its sponsorship work, particularly in the areas of performing due diligence on the listing applicants and preparing listing application documents;

transfers between Guoyuan’s clients and third parties which were unverified and unrelated to the clients.  Two clients’ accounts alone recorded an aggregate of fund transfers to and from third parties totalling $665.3 million.  These third party fund transfers, which were purportedly repayment to or receipt from “friends” or “business partners”, were routinely processed and accepted by Guoyuan’s senior management without making further enquiries.\r\n\n\t- Suspicious patterns suggesting the two clients’ accounts were used as depository accounts or conduits for transfers were evident in some instances where monies from third parties were deposited in the clients’ accounts and equivalent or roughly similar amounts were withdrawn shortly thereafter, and then transferred to numerous other third parties without any securities trading in the clients’ accounts at the material time.  Furthermore, the activities in some Guoyuan’s clients’ accounts who received third party funds from the two clients were inconsistent with the clients’ declared net worth or annual income.\r\n\n\t- Despite such red flags, Guoyuan failed to identify them as suspicious transactions and/or follow up on them,

Financing Guidance Note, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing, and the Code of Conduct which require licensed corporations to:\r\n\n\t- conduct ongoing due diligence and scrutiny on clients’ transactions and pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions and all unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose.  The findings and outcomes of these examinations should be properly documented in writing; and\r\n\n\t- take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, including implementation of appropriate policies and procedures and ensuring their effectiveness and compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements (Notes 2 to 6).\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account:\r\n\n\t- the duration of Guoyuan’s failures was more than a year;\r\n\n\t- Guoyuan cooperated with the SFC in resolving the SFC’s concerns;\r\n\n\t- Guoyuan has implemented new policies and procedures in relation to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, taken steps to remedy its internal control deficiencies and the former senior management team has left;\r\n\n\t- Guoyuan agreed to engage an independent reviewer to conduct a review of its internal controls; and\r\n\n\t- Guoyuan has an otherwise clean disciplinary record.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Guoyuan is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4

customer’s source of funds.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 6.2.8 of the AMLGN and paragraphs 5.1(c) and 5.10 of the AML/CFT Guideline require licensed corporations to pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions and all unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose.  The background and purpose, including where appropriate the circumstances, of the transactions should be examined.  The findings and outcomes of these examinations should be properly documented in writing and be available to assist the relevant authorities.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 4.2.2

allowed the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) appeal against the Market Misconduct Tribunal’s (MMT) findings that two former executives of Asia Telemedia Limited (ATML) (now known as Yunfeng Financial Group Limited), Mr Charles Yiu Hoi Ying and Ms Marian Wong Nam, had not engaged in insider dealing (Note 1).\r\n\nThe MMT in a decision in November 2015 acquitted Yiu and Wong on the basis of their defence under section 271(3) of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), which provided that a person should be acquitted if he did not have a purpose of making profit by using inside information (Note 2).\r\n\nThe MMT found that (i) the sole motivation of Yiu and Wong in selling ATML shares was to seize the opportunity to sell at the surge prices and (ii) they did not use the inside information since they believed that whatever threatened the share price of ATML stemming from the company’s problems would be resolved “behind closed doors” in the future, and would not influence the market price of the shares.\r\n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld the MMT’s decision in April 2017 following an appeal brought by the SFC which argued that the defence under section 271(3) of the SFO should not be applicable to Yiu and Wong. \r\n\nThe CFA, in a majority decision of four to one, held that Yiu and Wong failed to establish that they did not use inside information to secure profits.  In selling ATML shares, they did take advantage of their knowledge that the prices they were securing would not have been achievable if the information was disclosed to the market.  By doing so, they were using inside information and so were excluded from the defence under section 271(3) of the SFO.\r\n\nWhen Yiu and Wong traded their shares for profit, they were using the inside information at that very time and a belief as to what might happen in the future to resolve ATML’s problems was not relevant.\r\n\nIn the dissenting judgment, Mr Justice Tang PJ, held that the section 271(3) of the SFO defence should be interpreted to provide a defence for a defendant who can show that he would have done what he did even if he had not had the information.  On the facts, Tang PJ held that the MMT did not make an error in fact or in law.\r\n\nIn allowing the appeal, the CFA – in a majority of four to one – set aside the orders made by the Court of Appeal and the MMT and remitted the matter back to the MMT to deal with sanctions.\r\n\n\"We are pleased with the Court’s decision.  This case involves important points of law which goes to the heart of the insider dealing

fined Interactive Brokers Hong Kong Limited (IBHK) $4.5 million after resolving concerns over IBHK’s breaches of the Code of Conduct in its execution of market orders using electronic and algorithmic trading systems (Notes 1 & 2).\r\n\nThe SFC’s disciplinary action followed two market disruption incidents in 2015 and 2016 where the share prices of Hong Kong-listed O-Net Communications (Group) Limited and AAG Energy Holdings Limited were ramped up by 48.7 per cent and 126 per cent, respectively, in less than two minutes.\r\n\nIn light of the incidents, the SFC and IBHK jointly engaged an independent reviewer to review IBHK’s electronic and algorithmic trading systems, in particular, the controls to monitor and prevent the generation of or passing to the market for execution order instructions which may interfere with the operation of a fair and orderly market.\r\n\nThe review found that, in the two incidents, IBHK executed market orders by placing the entire order volume to the market and repeatedly submitting the unexecuted part of the order at the next available price until the entire order was completed. It also found that IBHK did not take into account the liquidity of the market when executing the market orders. Furthermore, IBHK failed to put in place effective price and volume controls to prevent its execution of market orders from disrupting the market (Note 3).\r\n\nIn respect of IBHK’s electronic and algorithmic trading systems, the review indicated that:\r\n\n\t- IBHK’s electronic trading system was developed by its head office in the United States, where its programming function was responsible for both development and quality assurance of the system. IBHK did not conduct adequate user acceptance testing on the system; and\r\n\n\t- the technical design documents of the systems were high level and did not provide a detailed explanation of the components of the trading systems. A specific example is that IBHK did not keep adequate records in relation to the design, development, deployment or operation of the order cancellation functionality in its electronic trading system (Note 4).\r\n\nIn reaching the resolution, the SFC took into account that IBHK:\r\n\n\t- involved their senior management in the liaison with the SFC about the regulatory concerns;\r\n\n\t- took the initiative to bring this matter to a conclusion by fully and frankly discussing the regulatory concerns with the SFC;\r\n\n\t- undertook a review with the SFC to address the regulatory concerns and identify the deficiencies in its internal controls; and\r\n\n\t- co-operated with the disciplinary action by resolving the SFC’s regulatory concerns.\r\n\nThe SFC also took into consideration IBHK’s board of directors have undertaken that reasonable steps will be implemented to ensure IBHK’s compliance with the regulatory requirements for electronic and algorithmic trading, and the failures set out above will be rectified within 12 months. Otherwise, similar failures would have resulted in a substantially higher level of fine.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- IBHK is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) and Type 3 (leveraged foreign exchange trading) regulated activities. \r\n\n\t- Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC (Code of Conduct).\r\n\n\t- Among others, paragraph 3.3.1 of Schedule 7 to the Code of Conduct provides that a licensed person should have controls that are reasonably designed to monitor and prevent the generation of or passing to the market for execution order instructions from its algorithmic trading system which may interfere with the operation of a fair and orderly market.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 3.2 of Schedule 7 to the Code of Conduct provides that a licensed person should ensure that the algorithmic trading system and trading algorithms it uses or provides to clients for use are adequately tested to ensure that they operate as designed.

Ardon Maroon gave instructions to a brokerage to execute a cross trade for 15 million shares of a listed company on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on 8 August 2014, which resulted in the AM Fund conducting a wash trade.  Ardon Maroon then instructed another brokerage to deliver the relevant shares to settle the wash trade.\r\n\nA cross trade that does not involve any change of beneficial ownership is a wash trade which is presumed to be manipulative under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) and is not in the best interests of market integrity (Note 2).  The wash trade conducted

and\r\n\n\t- Citi did not interview one of the three customers with whom Real Gold had allegedly entered into MLCs with, and when Citi did interview another one of them, no question about the MLC was asked.  Citi also did not verify the authenticity of the MLCs.      \r\n\nUnder these circumstances, the SFC considers that Citi’s approach towards customer due diligence was not justified by the relevant regulatory requirements and the SFC’s view is supported by the opinion of an independent market expert (Note 4).\r\n\nFailure to supervise the transaction team\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation found that the sponsor principals did not supervise the transaction team in the manner expected of them under the Additional Fit and Proper Guidelines for Corporations and Authorized Financial Institutions applying or continuing to act as Sponsors and Compliance Advisers (Sponsor Guidelines) (Note 5).  For instance:\r\n\n\t- A sponsor principal was only appointed to supervise the transaction team more than four months after Citi was mandated by Real Gold to act as the listing sponsor, by which time preparation for Real Gold’s listing application, including making arrangements for due diligence calls with major customers, suppliers and banks and drafting of the Prospectus, as well as due diligence on connected transactions, were well underway. \r\n\n\t- One of the sponsor principals was a director of another investment banking team at Citi, and listing applications were not her responsibility.  She thought that she was the “signing responsible officer” of Real Gold’s listing application while another team member was the sponsor principal.  She was not involved in conducting due diligence nor corresponding with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK).  Her involvement was limited to assisting the deal team when she was called upon to do so, for example, when the deal team needed a responsible officer to sign certain documents.\r\n\n\t- It appeared that the transaction team was mainly supervised by a managing director who was not a sponsor principal but was nonetheless involved in the due diligence on the assets and operations of Real Gold.\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation also found that the due diligence work conducted on Real Gold’s customers was handled by junior and inexperienced staff members of Citi with little supervision.  For instance:\r\n\n\t- The telephone interviews with Real Gold’s customers were organised and attended by an analyst and a senior analyst, who were the most junior members of the transaction team, with apparently little supervision, notwithstanding the participation in these calls by external legal counsel.\r\n\n\t- The deal team captain had assigned the workstream involving due diligence on Real Gold’s customers to the senior analyst, the second most junior member of the transaction team, and expected him to raise any significant issue for discussion.\r\n\nIn view of the deficiencies in Citi’s due diligence work identified above, notwithstanding Citi’s view that its approach to due diligence was the result of a reasoned weighting of production-related concerns over customer-related concerns, it appeared that Citi was in breach of its undertaking and declaration to SEHK (Note 6).\r\n\nIn reaching this resolution, the SFC took into account all circumstances, including:\r\n\n\t- this is the first and only listing application in which the SFC has had concerns over Citi’s work as a listing sponsor;\r\n\n\t- the breaches and deficiencies identified above related to a limited portion of the due diligence conducted by Citi in the course of Real Gold’s listing application;\r\n\n\t- the SFC found no evidence that the breaches and deficiencies identified above were deliberate, intentional or reckless;\r\n\n\t- Citi’s approach to due diligence reflected a reasoned weighting of production-related concerns over customer-related concerns, albeit one that the SFC does not consider to be compliant with the relevant regulatory requirements;\r\n\n\t- Citi’s early engagement of its senior management and an external counsel to address the SFC’s regulatory concerns;\r\n\n\t- Citi has taken action to strengthen its internal controls and systems in respect of its sponsor work since Real Gold’s listing; and\r\n\n\t- Citi’s full cooperation with the SFC to resolve the SFC’s regulatory concerns.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Citi is licensed to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 5 (advising on futures contracts), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.\r\n\n\t- Real Gold was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) on 23 February 2009 with Citi as its sole sponsor.  At the request of the company, trading in the shares of Real Gold was suspended on 27 May 2011.  On 28 June 2016, the SFC directed the suspension of the company’s shares under Rule 8(1) of the Securities and Futures (Stock Market Listing) Rules.\r\n\n\t- The customer-related due diligence carried out by Citi included collecting materials (such as shipment records and sales contracts) from Real Gold during its on-site diligence; conducting customer interviews; relying on Real Gold’s reporting accountant and auditor to verify customer revenues; as well as obtaining a legal opinion as to the validity and enforceability of the memorandums.\r\n\n\t- Details of the relevant regulatory requirements are set out in the Statement of Disciplinary Action.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 1.3.3 of the Sponsor Guidelines provides that, “As a general guidance, a Principal is expected to be in charge of the supervision of the Transaction Team(s).

mistakenly presumed that those accounts were non-interest bearing.  The misconception lasted until July 2016 when HSIM communicated with the funds’ trustees to confirm the nature of the current

December 2009 (2009 AR) and (3) interim results announcement and interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2010 (2010 IR), which induced transactions in the shares of China Forestry (Notes 1, 2

materially false or misleading, and both the former chairman and CEO were aware of, or were reckless or negligent, as to whether the disclosed information was materially false or misleading.\r\n\nThe scope of the allegedly false or misleading information as disclosed by China Forestry was extensive, covering the company’s turnover generating activities, profit, plantation assets and cash balances, etc.  Among these, China Forestry’s turnover appeared to have been overstated by at least 92% while its plantation assets, purportedly accounting for over 79% of its net assets, appeared to have been overstated by at least 87%.\r\n\nThe SFC also alleges that China Forestry’s purported supporting documents such as bank statements, forestry right certificates, and insurance contracts were falsified.   \r\n\nThe SFC’s case is that China Forestry maintained a separate set of accounting records which was different from the set of accounting records provided to its then auditors KPMG for auditing purposes but appeared to reflect its true state of affairs.  This separate set of accounting records revealed a much smaller scale of operation compared to what had been disclosed in the company’s IPO prospectus, 2009 AR and 2010 IR.  The SFC alleges that China Forestry, in its true state of affairs, was not suitable to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK).\r\n\nThe SFC

(ii) arrange overseas customers which could not terminate the TPP Arrangement to sign an indemnity agreement (Indemnity Agreement); and (iii) interview the third party payers before submitting Fujian Dongya’s listing application to The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) (Notes 3, 4 & 5).\r\n\nCCBIC, however, did not complete the due diligence plan prepared by its lawyers.  For instance, it did not obtain from Fujian Dongya a list of customers which could not terminate the TPP Arrangement and select some of these customers for interview.  It also did not interview any third party payers (Note 6).\r\n\nIn the course of conducting the due diligence, CCBIC also discovered a number of red flags concerning the TPP Arrangement but there was no evidence that it had made further enquiries with the relevant customers or third party payers, nor records of its justifications for not doing so.  The red flags included that: \r\n\n\t- a number of Fujian Dongya’s customers relied on multiple third party payers from different countries to pay Fujian Dongya; \r\n\n\t- some customers of Fujian Dongya acted as the third party payers of other Fujian Dongya’s customers when they also relied on third party payers to make payments to Fujian Dongya; and\r\n\n\t- Fujian Dongya informed CCBIC that it was impossible or very costly for its customers in Taiwan to make direct payments to Fujian Dongya but our investigation revealed that various third party payers in Taiwan had made payments to Fujian Dongya on behalf of its customers.\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation also revealed that one of the members of CCBIC’s transaction team had raised concerns about the genuineness of the signatures on the Indemnity Agreements.\r\n\nAfter reviewing the Indemnity Agreements, the SFC found that:\r\n\n\t- some of the Indemnity Agreements appeared to have been signed by the same person on behalf of different customers; and\r\n\n\t- some of the Indemnity Agreements were apparently signed by the same person in different countries on behalf of different customers on the same day.  \r\n\nFailure to conduct proper customer due diligence \r\n\nWhile CCBIC planned to conduct face-to-face interviews with Fujian Dongya’s customers in the absence of Fujian Dongya representatives and had made it clear to Fujian Dongya that telephone interviews would only be conducted with a small number of customers who could provide reasonable explanations as to why they could not attend face-to-face interviews, the SFC’s investigation found that:\r\n\n\t- Of the 22 overseas customers interviewed by CCBIC, only 12 of them were interviewed in face-to-face meetings and 11 of these 12 interviews were conducted in the presence of one or two Fujian Dongya representatives;\r\n\n\t- 8 of these 12 interviews were not conducted in the customers’ premises; and \r\n\n\t- 10 customers were interviewed by telephone but there is no record as to why these customers could not attend face-to-face interviews.\r\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence to show that CCBIC had taken steps to verify that the interviewees had the appropriate authority and knowledge to attend the interviews.\r\n\nFailure to keep a proper audit trail or written record \r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation also found that CCBIC did not keep a proper audit trail or written record of its due diligence work.  For example, CCBIC did not maintain records that could explain its decision of not completing the above-mentioned due diligence plan (Note 7).\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- the SFC found no evidence that the breaches and deficiencies identified above were deliberate, intentional or reckless;\r\n\n\t- CCBIC cooperated with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary action and did not dispute the SFC’s findings and regulatory concerns;\r\n\n\t- there is no evidence that suggests that there is a systemic failure in CCBIC’s policies, procedures and practices in respect of its sponsor work;   \r\n\n\t- CCBIC has on its own initiative enhanced its internal controls and systems in respect of its sponsor work since Fujian Dongya’s listing application and it agreed to engage an independent reviewer to review its enhanced policies, procedures and practices in relation to its sponsor work, particularly, in performing due diligence on listing applicants and preparing listing application documents;\r\n\n\t- Fujian Dongya’s listing application had lapsed; and\r\n\n\t- CCBIC has an otherwise clean disciplinary record.\r\n\nThe SFC would like to remind sponsors that before submitting a listing application to the SEHK, they should have performed all reasonable due diligence in order to gain a thorough knowledge and understanding of the listing applicant’s business and satisfy itself that all information concerning the listing applicant in respect of the application was fully, fairly and accurately presented. \r\n\nA sponsor must also plan and execute its due diligence inquiries on information proposed to be disclosed in the IPO prospectus with professional skepticism and critically assess the information or documents provided by the listing applicant, recognising that it is possible for information or statements proposed to be disclosed in the IPO prospectus to be materially misstated due to error or fraud.\r\n\nThe SFC will continue to take action against sponsors who fail to fulfil these requirements.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- CCBIC is licensed to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.\r\n\n\t- Fujian Dongya applied for listing on the Main Board of the SEHK on 21 March 2014 with CCBIC as its sole sponsor.  The company’s listing application lapsed on 22 September 2014, i.e. six months after its submission of the application.\r\n\n\t- According to the draft letter of confirmation prepared by CCBIC’s lawyers, the customers were asked to confirm, among other things, that: (i) they were independent from Fujian Dongya and its directors, senior executives or major shareholders etc.; (ii) the names of the third party payers that made payment to Fujian Dongya; and (iii) the amounts of such payments.\r\n\n\t- According to the draft letter of confirmation prepared by CCBIC’s lawyers, the third party payers were asked to confirm, among other things, that: (i) they were independent from Fujian Dongya and its directors, senior executives, shareholders and staff etc.;

Upon demand from Pearl Oriental in August 2005, RMB 64.8 million (purportedly as principal plus interest) was repaid to Pearl Oriental. \r\n\nImmediately upon the repayment, Fan caused Pearl Oriental to pay out RMB64.5 million, again without the board’s approval, as an advance for an acquisition of a Mainland logistics business. In obtaining retrospective board approval for the acquisition, Fan failed to disclose important unfavourable findings emerged in the due diligence on the logistic business and to present accurate information about its valuation. As a result, the board approved the payment without taking any reasonable steps to verify the information presented by Fan.\r\n\nHowever, the RMB64.5 million was actually transferred to Mainland companies connected to Fan.

disciplinary action came after an admission by HPI that it had transferred client money up to $8 million to the accounts of its overseas brokers between March 2013 and April 2014.  \r\n\nThe SFC found that HPI:\r\n\n\t- transferred client money from its segregated client account maintained at a bank in Hong Kong to its accounts with two overseas brokers on six occasions; \r\n\n\t- used the client money transferred to one of the two overseas brokers to conduct proprietary transactions; and\r\n\n\t- remitted all client money from its overseas brokers’ accounts back to the segregated client account in Hong Kong after discovering that the conduct might constitute a breach of the Securities and Futures (Client Money) Rules (CMR).\r\n\nIn doing so, HPI breached the Code of Conduct and the CMR by failing to maintain client money in a segregated client account in Hong Kong with an authorized financial institution (Notes 2, 3 & 4).\r\n\nHPI’s use of the client money to conduct proprietary transactions also constitutes a breach of its fundamental duty as a licensed intermediary to ensure that client assets are promptly and properly accounted for and adequately safeguarded (Note

The total repayment amount is approximately HK$200 million and covers overcharges made through post-trade spread increases and charges in excess of standard disclosures or rates between 2008 and 2017. The overcharge practices affected about 5,000 Hong Kong-managed client accounts in about 28,700 transactions (Note 2).\r\n\nThe SFC considers that UBS not only failed to observe the fundamental and overarching duty to act in its clients’ best interests but also abused the trust of unsuspecting clients by failing to disclose conflicts of interest and overcharging them in opaque trades.\r\n\nMr Ashley Alder, the SFC’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “The SFC expects all intermediaries to uphold high standards of integrity when managing trades for clients. UBS fell far short of these expectations by systematically overcharging a very large number of clients over many years. Although each overcharge represented a fraction of each trade, UBS’s misconduct involved deception and a pervasive abuse of trust resulting in significant additional revenue for UBS to which it was not entitled.”  \r\n\nThe SFC’s investigations revealed that:\r\n\n\t- between 2008 and 2015, the client advisors (CAs) and client advisors’ assistants (CAAs) in UBS’s Wealth Management division had overcharged clients when conducting bond and structured note trades by increasing the spread charged after the execution of trades without clients’ knowledge; and\r\n\n\t- between 2008 and 2017, UBS had also charged its clients fees in excess of its standard disclosures or rates. \r\n\nSpecifically, following their clients’ requests to buy or sell products, the CAs and CAAs would enter the limit order price of the clients’ trades into UBS’s client order processing system. In circumstances where the actual execution price achieved in the market was better than the limit order price, the CAs and CAAs would increase the spread after executing the trades in order to retain the price improvement for UBS without agreement with, or disclosure to, the clients, and sometimes misreported the execution price or spread to the clients. On some occasions, they would also falsify the account statements issued to financial intermediaries, who were authorized to trade for clients, by misreporting the spread amount to conceal the overcharges.\r\n\nThe SFC considers that these malpractices involved a combination of serious systemic failures for a prolonged period of time including inadequate policies, procedures and system controls, lack of staff training and supervision, and failures of the first and second lines of defence functions of UBS.\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation further found that:\r\n\n\t- UBS failed to understand and properly disclose the capacity in which it acted for its clients when conducting secondary market bond and structured note trades. UBS acknowledged that its historical approach to capacity was confused, its past communications with regulators regarding its capacity were incomplete, and its communications with clients on whether it was acting as their agent or principal were unclear and, in some cases, erroneous;\r\n\n\t- UBS failed to report its spread overcharge practices to the SFC until two years after the identification of the misconduct.  This was not an isolated incident, but was one of a number of late reporting incidents whereby UBS failed to report the relevant misconduct to the SFC in a timely manner, or at all; and\r\n\n\t- as system enhancements following the discovery of the spread overcharge practices, UBS implemented a new order taking platform, One Wealth Management Platform (1WMP), in October 2017.  However, instead of putting in place a system that ensures its compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, UBS reported 15 incidents to the SFC or the Hong Kong Monetary Authority relating to the failures of 1WMP covering a variety of issues, including further spread overcharges.  These issues call into question UBS’s capability to put in place effective remediation to address the spread overcharge practices and proper internal controls to avoid the recurrence of historical deficiencies.\r\n\nUnder the circumstances, the SFC considers UBS failed to:\r\n\n\t- act honestly, fairly and in the best interests of its clients;\r\n\n\t- act with due skill, care and diligence, in the best interests of its clients;\r\n\n\t- avoid conflicts of interest and ensure that its clients are treated fairly;\r\n\n\t- provide adequate disclosure of relevant material information to clients; and\r\n\n\t- comply with all relevant regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of its business activities so as to promote the best interests of clients.\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanctions, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including:\r\n\n\t- the elements of dishonesty in UBS’s spread overcharge practices;\r\n\n\t- the duration of UBS’s spread overcharge practices, i.e. around ten years;\r\n\n\t- the fact that UBS’s spread overcharge practices were undetected for at least seven years;\r\n\n\t- the serious and systemic nature of UBS’s internal control failures;\r\n\n\t- UBS’s disciplinary actions against over 20 staff who had engaged in the malpractice;\r\n\n\t- UBS’s appointments of independent reviewers to (i) identify the root causes of the spread overcharge practices and assess the magnitude of its spread overcharge practices, (ii) validate the relevant overcharge and compensation arising from 1WMP, and (iii) review the adequacy and effectiveness of UBS’s remediation measures; (Note 3) and\r\n\n\t- UBS’s agreement to fully compensate the affected clients.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- UBS is a registered institution under the SFO to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance), Type 7 (providing automated trading services) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- UBS has engaged an independent reviewer to assess and validate the compensation amount to be paid to the affected clients.

connection with their roles in window-dressing the liquid capital of Falcon (Note 1).\r\n\nAng was the mastermind of the window-dressing scheme and its operation was facilitated by Chan.\r\n\nThe disciplinary action against Ang and Chan follows the SFC’s revocation of the licence of Falcon in February 2019 for window-dressing its liquid capital and other failures.  The SFC also found that Falcon provided the SFC with false or misleading information in its licence application and financial returns between June 2014 and June 2017 (Note 2).  Ang also failed to notify the SFC of Falcon’s insufficient liquid capital and his resignation as a director.\r\n\nUnder Ang’s scheme, Falcon’s month-end liquid capital was window-dressed by including in its liquid capital computation the amount of cheques he drew on certain bank accounts, which were subsequently dishonoured.  This practice was adopted from the time of Falcon’s SFC licence application in June 2014.  Had the amount of these cheques issued by Ang been excluded, Falcon would have been denied a licence to carry on regulated activities due to a liquid capital deficit at the time of its licence application and at each of the month-ends over a three-year period.\r\n\nChan, who reported to Ang, had full access to various bank accounts of which Ang was a signatory.  As the person in charge of accounting, he was fully aware of the true financial condition of Falcon.  He was also aware that cheques signed by Ang would certainly be dishonored upon presentation due to insufficient funds in the bank accounts on which they were drawn and closure of some of these accounts.  But he continued to take part in the window-dressing scheme to disguise Falcon’s failure to maintain sufficient capital as required for as long as possible.\r\n\nAng subsequently resigned from Falcon on 23 October 2017, but he failed to provide the SFC with written notification of such resignation within seven business days as required.\r\n\nThe SFC is of the view that the misconduct of Falcon was a result of Ang and Chan’s consent or connivance, or attributable to neglect on their part as members of senior management, and should also be regarded as misconduct on their part.  Their failures cast serious doubt on their ability to carry on regulated activities competently and call into question their fitness and properness to be licensed by the SFC.\r\n\nIn deciding the penalty, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including:\r\n\n\t- the honesty and integrity of Ang and Chan have been impugned;\r\n\n\t- their egregious and serious misconduct caused Falcon to damage investors’ and the public’s confidence in market integrity;\r\n\n\t- their otherwise clean disciplinary record; and\r\n\n\t- the need to prohibit them from the industry in order to protect the investing public.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Ang and Chan were not licensed persons under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.  Both come within the definition of a “regulated person” which include a person who is or at the relevant time was a person involved in the management of the business of a licensed corporation. \r\n\n\t-

executive officer and executive director, Mr Chung Man Wai (Notes 1 to 4).\r\n\nThe SFC’s action follows an investigation into Luxey’s very substantial acquisition of Easy Time Trading Limited (Easy Time) which held a 99 per cent stake in Ratio Knitting Factory Limited (Ratio) at the time of the acquisition on 31 March 2011.\r\n\nThe SFC alleges that Lau breached his director’s duties to Luxey by utilising nominees Big Good Management Limited (Big Good) and its sole shareholder and director, Mr Ma Hoi Cheuk, who acted on his instructions, to acquire Ratio for $50.1 million before Ratio (through Easy Time) was resold to Luxey for $390 million.  Lau allegedly obtained a profit or at least part of such profit – namely, the difference between the $50.1 million Big Good paid to acquire Ratio and the substantially higher price of $390 million for which Luxey acquired Ratio.  He also concealed his secret profit and/or material interest in these transactions (Scheme).\r\n\nAs a result of the Scheme, Luxey was deprived of the opportunity to acquire Easy Time or Ratio at a price substantially lower than the consideration of $390 million.\r\n\nThe SFC also alleges that Chung breached his director’s duties to Luxey by failing to make sufficient enquiries about the relationships among Lau, Ma and Big Good and to take steps to prevent Luxey from acquiring Easy Time at a substantially higher price while knowing or ought to have known that the Scheme, if carried out, would result in a loss to Luxey. \r\n\nThe SFC further alleges that Lau and Chung were culpably responsible for the publication of false statements in Luxey’s announcement and circular relating to the very substantial acquisition in that Big Good and Ma were not disclosed as non-independent third parties and the transaction was not at arm’s length and the terms of the acquisition were not on normal commercial terms, nor were they fair and reasonable and in the interests of Luxey and its shareholders as a whole. \r\n\nAgainst this background, the SFC alleges that Lau and Chung, in their capacity as directors of Luxey at the material time, conducted the company’s business or affairs in a manner

licence of Mr Cen Tian for two years from 14 March 2019 to 13 March 2021 for failing to discharge his supervisory duties as a sponsor principal in charge of supervision of the execution of China Forestry’s listing application (Note 4).\r\n\nThe SFC has today also taken action against other joint sponsors involved in the listing applications of China Forestry and Tianhe.\r\n\nSponsor failings in China Forestry’s listing application \r\n\nThe SFC’s investigations revealed that UBS had failed to make reasonable due diligence enquiries in relation to a number of core aspects of China Forestry’s business (Note 5).\r\n\n(i)  Failure to verify the existence of China Forestry’s forestry assets\r\n\nAccording to China Forestry’s 2009 prospectus, the company and its subsidiaries (China Forestry Group), a plantation forest operator whose main businesses were the management and sustainable development of forests and the harvesting and sale of logs, owned approximately 171,780 hectares of forests in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces of Mainland China.   \r\n\nUBS became a joint sponsor of China Forestry’s listing application in or around May/June 2009.  However, UBS did not conduct any site inspection of China Forestry Group’s forests after it became a sponsor.  Although UBS claimed that it had carried out physical inspections at a number of China Forestry Group’s forests in Sichuan and Yunnan in 2008 in its then capacity as one of the joint bookrunners, it was unable to provide any inspection records or identify the precise locations of the inspections.    \r\n\nUBS claimed that other professional parties, including lawyers and forestry experts, were involved in some of the site inspections.  However, none of them had been instructed to verify the existence of China Forestry Group’s forests as disclosed in the prospectus.\r\n\nFurther, despite the fact that China Forestry Group acquired 150,000 hectares of forests in Yunnan in 2008 which accounted for over 90% of its forestry assets, there is no evidence to suggest that UBS visited China Forestry Group’s forests in Yunnan or commissioned any assessment of the impact of the earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale that hit Yunnan on 9 July 2009 on them. \r\n\n(ii)  Failure to verify China Forestry Group’s forestry rights\r\n\nAccording to the prospectus, China Forestry Group’s legal rights over its forests were evidenced by the relevant forestry right certificates.  While UBS claimed to have inspected the original certificates, it did not identify a number of apparent anomalies (such as, a mismatch between the name of a forest as disclosed in the prospectus and as stated in the corresponding certificates) that should have called for further inquiries. \r\n\nUBS also claimed that its Mainland Chinese lawyers had verified and checked the certificates.  However, this was not reflected in the relevant legal opinions.  In fact, the legal opinions contained express assumptions as to the genuineness and accuracy of documents China Forestry provided to the lawyers.\r\n\n(iii)  Failure to verify China Forestry’s compliance with relevant laws and regulations\r\n\nUBS relied on written confirmations purportedly issued by the relevant forestry bureaus that China Forestry had provided for it to confirm that the business and logging activities of China Forestry were in compliance with the relevant Mainland Chinese forestry laws.  There is, however, no evidence that UBS had verified whether the written confirmations were issued by the relevant forestry bureaus and that the information recorded therein was accurate.\r\n\n(iv)  Inadequate due diligence on insurance coverage for China Forestry Group’s forestry assets\r\n\nHaving sufficient insurance coverage for China Forestry Group’s forestry assets, which were pivotal to its business operation, was of fundamental importance.  UBS relied on insurance documents provided by China Forestry as evidence of such insurance coverage without independently verifying the authenticity of the insurance documents. \r\n\nAlthough UBS claimed that its deal team members and Mainland Chinese lawyers had reviewed the insurance documents, it did not identify a number of issues (such as, inconsistencies between the locations of certain forests as stated in the insurance documents and as disclosed in the prospectus) that should have called for further inquiries. \r\n\n(v)  Inadequate due diligence on China Forestry’s customers\r\n\nOver 70% of China Forestry’s customers by revenue for the last 18 months during its track record period were located in Yunnan (Note 6).  UBS had planned to conduct face-to-face interviews with some of China Forestry’s customers in Yunnan, but subsequently decided to postpone the face-to-face interviews because of the earthquake in Yunnan.  UBS only conducted telephone interviews with these customers in the end.\r\n\nThe SFC found that UBS called the customers on telephone numbers provided by China Forestry without conducting any background searches on the customers to verify their telephone numbers and/or the identities of the individuals interviewed.  The SFC also found that the records of the interviews were seriously inadequate.\r\n\nThe SFC also found that UBS’s failures in China Forestry’s listing application were attributable to the neglect on the part of Cen, in his capacity as a sponsor principal, of his supervisory duties (Note 7).\r\n\nSponsor failings in Tianhe’s listing application \r\n\nThe SFC’s investigations revealed that UBS, one of the joint sponsors in Tianhe’s listing application, had failed to follow the specific guidelines on due diligence interviews in paragraph 17.6 of the Code of Conduct (Notes 8, 9 and 10).\r\n\n(i)  Involvement of Tianhe in due diligence interviews\r\n\nUBS had interviewed ten customers of Tianhe: six of which were interviewed either by telephone or at face-to-face interviews at Tianhe’s offices in Jinzhou of Mainland China, and the rest of them were interviewed at the customers’ own premises.\r\n\nUBS did not have direct contact with the customers when they set up the interviews or confirmed the mode and place of the interviews.  On the contrary, Tianhe took the lead in informing UBS which customers were unable to attend face-to-face interviews, and which customers refused to conduct interviews at their business premises.  There is no evidence that UBS had taken any steps to check with the customers as to why they were not amenable to be interviewed at their offices.\r\n\n(ii)  Failure to address red flags raised in an interview\r\n\nUBS had initially requested to interview the largest customer of Tianhe, Customer X, at its office, but they eventually accepted Tianhe’s explanation that since an anti-corruption campaign in Mainland China was underway, Customer X, a large state-owned enterprise, would normally turn down any third party request to visit its premises.\r\n\nUBS then agreed to interview Customer X at Tianhe’s office.  At the end of the interview, the representative of Customer X refused to produce his identity and business cards and stormed out of the meeting room.  He told UBS that he would not have agreed to be interviewed under Customer X’s internal procedure, and he only attended the interview to help the family of Tianhe’s chief executive officer (CEO).\r\n\nNonetheless, UBS did not conduct any follow up inquiries to ascertain that the person it interviewed was the representative of Customer X and that he had the appropriate authority and knowledge for the interview.\r\n\n(iii)  Unclear interview questions\r\n\nTianhe conducted business with its customers through its subsidiary, Jinzhou DPF-TH Chemicals Co. Limited (Jinzhou DPF-TH), based upon the sales documents provided to UBS.\r\n\nDuring the customer interviews, UBS asked the interviewees questions in relation to the business between their companies and the “Tianhe Group”, instead of Jinzhou DPF-TH.  Although the interviewees were also asked a question “which entity of the Tianhe Group and which business department do you mainly contact with”, only three out of ten customers interviewed confirmed that they had contact with Jinzhou DPF-TH.  However, UBS did not follow up with the remaining customers as to which entity of the “Tianhe Group” they had business with.\r\n\nOne of the purported top ten customers of Tianhe interviewed by UBS informed the SFC that when its representative answered questions about the dealings between the customer and the “Tianhe Group” during the interview, its representative was referring to the dealings with Liaoning Tianhe Fine Chemicals, a private company wholly owned by the family of the CEO of Tianhe but no longer a part of Tianhe’s group to be listed at the material times.\r\n\nAs both the listed and unlisted chemical businesses of the family of the CEO of Tianhe were named “Tianhe”, the SFC considers that it was insufficient for UBS to merely refer to the “Tianhe Group” during customer interviews and/or not to request the interviewees to identify the exact Tianhe entity with which their organisations had dealings.\r\n\nIn deciding on the sanctions, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- UBS’s sponsor failings concerned three listing applications, including China Forestry and Tianhe;\r\n\n\t- the deficiencies identified in relation to UBS are extensive:\n\n\n\n\t- UBS had failed to properly examine and verify the fundamental aspects of China Forestry’s business - namely, its forestry assets, logging activities, insurance coverage and customers; and\r\n\n\t- UBS allowed Tianhe to control the due diligence process and failed to take appropriate steps to address the red flags raised in the customer interviews.  In addition, the breaches and deficiencies identified above related to the due diligence conducted on Tianhe’s top customers, including its largest customer, during its track record period;\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\t- sponsors have considerable control over the listing process.  When sponsors perform substandard due diligence work and companies unsuitable for listing are nevertheless listed and eventually fail, their failure may cause enormous loss to public investors and jeopardise their confidence in Hong Kong’s financial markets.  As such, deterrent penalties for sponsor failures are warranted;\r\n\n\t- UBS and Cen cooperated with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary actions and the SFC’s findings and regulatory concerns; and \r\n\n\t- UBS agreed to engage an independent reviewer to review its policies, procedures and practices in relation to the conduct of its sponsor business.\r\n\nMr Ashley Alder, the SFC’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “The outcome of these enforcement actions for sponsor failures – particularly failings when conducting IPO due diligence – signify the crucial importance that the SFC places on the high standards of sponsors’ conduct to protect the investing public and maintain the integrity and reputation of Hong Kong’s financial markets.  The sanctions send a strong and clear message to the market that we will not hesitate to hold errant sponsors accountable for their misconduct.”       \r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- UBS AG is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance), Type 7 (providing automated trading services) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- UBS Securities Hong Kong is licensed to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contract), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regulated activities under the SFO.  With effect from 7 June 2012, a part of the Type 6 regulated activity carried on by UBS AG, namely, acting as sponsor in respect of an application for the listing of securities, was assumed by UBS Securities Hong Kong.\r\n\n\t- As the SFC’s disciplinary proceedings against other parties involved in the Other Listing Application are ongoing, the SFC will not disclose the detailed findings which led to its disciplinary action against UBS in relation to the Other Listing Application until the conclusion of its disciplinary proceedings against these other parties.\r\n\n\t- Cen was approved to act as a sponsor principal and an executive officer of UBS AG during the period from 11 October 2007 to 29 May 2013 and from 4 October 2007 to 27 May 2015 respectively.  Cen has also been licensed to carry on Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activity under the SFO as a representative of UBS Securities Hong Kong since 7 June 2012.\r\n\n\t- China Forestry was listed on the Main Board of the SEHK on 3 December 2009.  UBS and Standard Chartered Securities (Hong Kong) Limited were its Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Sponsors, Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Managers. Trading in the shares of China Forestry was suspended since 26 January 2011.  Subsequently, China Forestry was wound up and the listing of its shares was cancelled on 24 February 2017.\r\n\n\t- According to the prospectus, for the year ended 31 December 2008 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2009, approximately 70.5% and 81.4% respectively of China Forestry’s customers by revenue were located in Yunnan.\r\n\n\t- According to paragraph 1.3.3 of the Additional Fit and Proper Guidelines for Corporations and Authorized Financial Institutions applying for continuing to act as Sponsors and Compliance Advisers:\n\n\n\n “As a general guidance, a Principal is expected to be in charge of the supervision of the Transaction Team(s). The Principal should be involved in the making of the key decisions relating to the work carried out by the Transaction Team and must be aware of the key risks in such work and responsible for the measures to address them. For example, in respect of conducting due diligence review on a listing applicant, the sponsor should ensure that the Principal is involved in determining the breadth and depth of the due diligence review, the amount of resources to be deployed for carrying out such work, making a critical assessment of the results of the due diligence and overall assessment of the adequacy of the due diligence review, and ensuring that steps have been taken to properly resolve all issues arising out of such review...”\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\t- Tianhe was listed on the Main Board of SEHK on 20 June 2014, and was engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products.  At Tianhe’s request, trading in the shares of the company was suspended on 26 March 2015.  On 24 May 2017, the SFC issued a notice under section 8(1) of the Securities and Futures (Stock Market Listing) Rules directing the SEHK to suspend all dealings in the shares of Tianhe effective from 9 am on 25 May 2017.  Trading in Tianhe’s shares remains suspended as of today.\r\n\n\t- Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 17.6 (f) of the Code of Conduct provides that, in conducting interviews, the sponsor should, among other things:\r\n\n\t- carry out the interview directly with the person or entity selected for interview with minimal involvement of the listing applicant;\r\n\n\t- confirm the bona fides of the interviewee (including establishing the identity of the interviewee and other relevant information) to satisfy itself that the interviewee has the appropriate authority and knowledge for the interview;

Standard Chartered Securities only conducted telephone interviews with these customers in the end.\r\n\nThe SFC found that Standard Chartered Securities called the customers on telephone numbers provided by China Forestry without conducting any background searches on the customers to verify their telephone numbers and/or the identities of the individuals interviewed.  The SFC also found that the records of the interviews were seriously inadequate.\r\n\nIn deciding on the sanctions, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- the deficiencies in the due diligence conducted by Standard Chartered Securities are significant, i.e. it has failed to properly examine and verify crucial aspects of China Forestry’s business - namely, its forestry assets, logging activities, insurance coverage and customers;\r\n\n\t- substandard due diligence work of sponsors could facilitate the listing of companies that are, in fact, not suitable for listing. When companies listed in such circumstances fail, their failure may cause significant loss to public investors and jeopardise their confidence in Hong Kong financial markets.  As such, deterrent penalties  for  sponsor failures are warranted; and\r\n\n\t- Standard Chartered Securities cooperated with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary actions and the SFC’s findings and regulatory concerns.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Standard Chartered Securities formerly known as Cazenove Asia Limited (Cazenove), is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in Futures Contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 5 (advising on futures contracts) and Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) regulated activities.

a joint sponsor in relation to the listing application of China Metal Recycling (Holdings) Limited (China Metal) (Notes 1 to 3).\r\n\nThe disciplinary action followed the SFC’s earlier sanction against the other joint sponsor – UBS AG and UBS Securities Hong Kong Limited (collectively UBS) – for their failures in relation to the listing application of China Metal and two other companies (Note 4).   \r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation revealed that CMS and UBS had respectively failed in their due diligence as joint sponsors to address a number of unusual facts and findings on China Metal and its customers during the listing process (Note 5).\r\n\nInadequate due diligence with respect to a deregistered customer\r\n\nPrior to the filing of the first listing application of China Metal on 2 June 2008, UBS discovered that one of the largest Mainland customers of China Metal, Company A, had been deregistered since March 2007 but it continued to enter into sales contracts with China Metal or its subsidiary thereafter.\r\n\nDespite the following red flags raised in its due diligence, UBS accepted China Metal’s explanation that Company B, whose beneficial owner was the same as Company A, had entered into contracts with China Metal in the name of Company A since its deregistration, and Company B was eventually described as one of China Metal’s largest customers in documents submitted to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) and in China Metal’s prospectus dated 10 June 2009: \r\n\n(i)    a report in March 2008 commissioned by UBS to look into this matter stated that, “Since [Company A] has never engaged in any active business operation during its corporate history and has not reported any major transactions, we consider the claim that [Company A] is the largest customer of [China Metal] to be without merits (sic)”;\r\n\n(ii)   the company registration documents of Company A and Company B that UBS obtained in March 2008 did not support the assertion that they were related;\r\n\n(iii)  China Metal’s Mainland Chinese lawyers informed UBS’s foreign legal counsel (copying UBS) in early April 2008 that:\r\n\n\t- under Mainland Chinese law, a deregistered company is not entitled to enter into any business contracts, and as such, contracts that Company A entered into after its deregistration could be considered invalid and not enforceable; and\r\n\n\t- even if Company A and Company B were related, Company A should not have conducted any business operation after its deregistration;\r\n\n(iv) China Metal’s Mainland Chinese lawyers further informed UBS in late April 2008 that they were not aware of any legal basis for describing Company B as one of the largest customers of China Metal; and\r\n\n(v)  the documents provided by China Metal to UBS, including sales contracts, receipt vouchers and list of top customers, showed that Company A was the entity which purchased scrap metal from China Metal or its subsidiary.\r\n\nAlthough CMS only became a joint sponsor of China Metal in or around November 2008, and was not involved in the due diligence conducted prior to November 2008 on this issue, it had an independent duty to conduct due diligence in order to have a thorough knowledge and understanding of China Metal and to satisfy itself in relation to the information disclosed in the prospectus.\r\n\nThe SFC considers that if CMS had reviewed the due diligence documents provided by UBS and other professional parties with professional skepticism, it would have discovered that there were conflicting propositions on which entity or entities were contracting with China Metal at the material time, which raised a number of red flags about the genuineness of the transactions between China Metal and Company A and/or Company B.  The SFC considers that the evidence suggests that CMS had not taken any steps to conduct follow up due diligence on this issue.\r\n\nInadequate due diligence on third party payments\r\n\nIn September 2008, when UBS was still a sole sponsor for China Metal, the reporting accountant of China Metal sent certain information to China Metal (copying UBS) regarding six of its customers who made payments by cashier orders and/or remittance arranged by third party payers.\r\n\nIn one case, a customer who paid China Metal through a third party, also made payments on behalf of three other customers of China Metal.  There is no evidence that UBS had followed up with China Metal or any of the customers as to the relationship between the customers and reasons for them to enter into the payment arrangements.\r\n\nUBS instead relied on its Mainland Chinese lawyers to look into the payment arrangements between one of the six customers and China Metal.  UBS was advised by the Mainland Chinese lawyers to obtain various documents concerning the transactions, including the payment records from the customer to its third party payer, and customs documents showing the import/export of concerned goods, to verify the genuineness of the transactions and completion of customs procedures.\r\n\nHowever, UBS did not obtain the requested documents but instructed the lawyers to provide their legal opinion on the assumption that the transactions in question were genuine.\r\n\nInadequate due diligence on China Metal’s suppliers and customers\r\n\nUBS interviewed all suppliers of China Metal by telephone, and CMS also interviewed two suppliers by telephone before the filing of China Metal’s second listing application, but there is no evidence that they had verified the telephone numbers and/or the identities of the supplier representatives they interviewed.\r\n\nUBS and CMS conducted some of the interviews with China Metal’s customers face-to-face and others over the telephone.  The SFC’s investigation revealed that:\r\n\n(i)    none of the interview records indicates where the face-to-face interviews took place and whether UBS and/or CMS had taken any steps to verify whether the premises in which the interviews took place were the relevant customers’ premises; and\r\n\n(ii)   there is also no evidence that UBS and/or CMS had taken any steps to verify the identity of any of the customer representatives they interviewed, so as to satisfy themselves that they had the appropriate authority for the interviews.   \r\n\nIn deciding on the appropriate sanction against CMS, the SFC has taken into account:\r\n\n\t- CMS failed to exercise the important function of making a critical assessment with a questioning mind and being alert to red flags that contradict or bring into question the reliability of the information provided by China Metal and its joint sponsor;\r\n\n\t- CMS failed to discharge its independent duty to carry out proper due diligence enquiries and/or critically examine the documents and information provided by China Metal and its joint sponsor that contradicted or brought into question the reliability of the information provided by China Metal; \r\n\n\t- CMS had assisted the listing of a company that was not suitable for listing;\r\n\n\t- CMS cooperated with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary actions and the SFC’s regulatory concerns; and\r\n\n\t- CMS agreed to engage an independent reviewer to review its policies, procedures and practices in relation to the conduct of its sponsor business.\r\n\nEnd \r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- CMS is licensed under the SFO to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 9

(SFAT) today affirmed the decision of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to reprimand FT Securities Limited (FTSL) and fine it $3.5 million for regulatory breaches and internal control failures in relation to preparation and publication of research reports (Notes 1 to 3).\r\n\nFTSL published three equity research reports on its website between July 2012 and April 2013.  The SFC found that, during the relevant period:\r\n\n\t- FTSL’s research reports, which were published in the name of its research analyst, were in fact prepared and written by two unidentified individuals who were not its employees.  FTSL did not know their identities, background or contact details, nor did it take any steps to ascertain whether they were related to or had any financial interests in the companies covered in the research reports;\r\n\n\t- FTSL falsely disclosed in one of the research reports that it did not provide any investment banking services to the company covered in the research report in the 12 months preceding the publication of the report when in fact it had been appointed as the placing agent for the placing of the company’s convertible bonds (Note 4);\r\n\n\t- FTSL had no formal policies or procedures governing the preparation and publication of research reports;\r\n\n\t- FTSL did not segregate its research and corporate finance functions to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.  Staff members responsible for handling the placing activities of the company covered in the research report were concurrently involved in the preparation and publication of the report (Note 5); and\r\n\n\t- FTSL failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable basis for the analyses and recommendations in the research reports (Note 6).\r\n\nThe SFC concluded that FTSL had failed to supervise its staff members diligently in relation to the preparation and publication of the three research reports, and its internal systems and controls were seriously deficient.\r\n\nThe SFAT accepted that FTSL was culpable of egregious failures to comply with the regulatory requirements addressing analyst conflicts of interest, and its failure to ensure independence and objectivity of research reports might damage investor confidence in the research sector and in the financial services industry more broadly.\r\n\nEnd \r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- FTSL is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- The SFAT was presided over by the Hon Justice Lunn, Chairman of the SFAT.  The SFAT’s reasons for determination is available on its website at www.sfat.gov.hk.\r\n\n\t- The SFC has also suspended the licences of Ms Chan Ho Wai and Mr Lam Wai Kit, former responsible officers of FTSL, for nine months.  Chan was responsible for preparing and issuing the three equity research reports whilst Lam was responsible for approving the research reports.  Please see the SFC’s press release dated 10 December 2018.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 16.5(d) (disclosure by firms of relevant business relationships) of the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission (Code of Conduct) provides that a firm that has an investment banking relationship with the issuer or the new listing applicant should disclose that fact in the research report.  Any compensation or mandate for investment banking services received within the preceding 12 months would constitute an investment banking relationship.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 16.6(a)(i) of the Code of Conduct provides that a firm that has an investment banking function should not arrange for its analysts to report to such function.  Paragraph 2 under Part II (segregation of duties and functions) of the Management, Supervision and Internal Control Guidelines for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC further provides that a firm should take special care to ensure that the sales and dealing functions should be segregated from the research function where possibility of potential conflicts of interest exists, and where practicable, the research and the corporate finance functions should be segregated to ensure the objectivity of the research function.\r\n\n\t- Paragraph 16.11(a) of the Code of Conduct provides that an analyst should have a reasonable basis for his analyses and recommendations.","known_entities":"FT Securities Limited|FT Securities Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued

restoration orders that the court may make for the benefit of affected counterparties to the impugned transactions involving Ching Lee shares. \r\n\nDeputy High Court Judge Liu yesterday ordered that the interim injunctions granted to the SFC on 15 July 2019 be continued, freezing assets of up to $124.9 million held by 15 local and overseas entities.  This represents the combined profit made by them and their nominees in their alleged manipulation activities involving Ching Lee shares.  The injunctions against several overseas entities cover their assets worldwide.\r\n\nThe SFC’s application for interim injunctions was made as part of the proceedings against 20 individuals and corporate entities (the defendants) alleging that they had devised, executed, or were otherwise involved in a scheme to manipulate Ching Lee shares, contrary to the SFO (Note 2). \r\n\nThe SFC alleged that the manipulative scheme was planned and commenced before Ching Lee’s listing on 29 March 2016, and lasted for more than five months, resulting in the artificial inflation of the share price and turnover of Ching Lee shares between 29 March 2016 and 6 September 2016 and the collapse of the Ching Lee’s share price by 90% on 7 September 2016.\r\n\nThe SFC is also seeking orders against the defendants to disgorge their profits and/or restore the affected counterparties to their pre-transaction positions if the Court finds the defendants in contravention of the relevant provisions of the SFO (Note 3).\r\n\nThe Court of First Instance further ordered that the interim injunctions against 15 of the defendants be continued until a substantive or directions hearing for the injunctions or further order.\r\n\nThe SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Thomas Atkinson, said: “Seeking injunction and restorative orders from the court against alleged cross-border manipulators is a key element of the SFC’s enforcement strategy to prevent alleged wrongdoers from cashing-in on their misdeeds and preserve suspected ill-gotten gains for future compensation to affected parties.  Underscoring the Commission’s commitment to zero tolerance of market misconduct and safeguarding the

International Limited (Magic) and five of its directors culpable of the company’s failure to disclose in a timely manner inside information on L’Oréal S.A.’s (L’Oréal) proposed acquisition of Magic in 2013, as required under the corporate disclosure requirements of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO)  (Notes 1 to 3).\r\n\nThe five Magic’s directors are: chairman, Mr Stephen Tang Siu Kun; executive directors, Mr She Yu Yuan, Mr Luo Yao Wen and Mr Cheng Wing Hong, who was also the company secretary at the material time; and non-executive director, Mr Sun Yan (collectively, the five directors).  Tang, She and Luo were co-founders of Magic (collectively, the founders).\r\n\nThe MMT was told that Magic and L’Oréal, a French cosmetics group, had discussions relating to the latter’s acquisition proposal since early March 2013.  In a meeting held on 27 April 2013, L’Oréal and Magic’s founders agreed that an offer price of not less than $5.5 per share would be put before Magic’s board of directors for their consideration.\r\n\nMagic’s founders indicated to L’Oréal that they would contact Magic’s institutional investors to gauge their interest in the acquisition proposal and they would also support L’Oréal’s request to Magic’s board of directors to carry out due diligence.\r\n\nHowever, Magic did not disclose the information relating to L’Oréal’s acquisition proposal to the public until August 2013.\r\n\nThe MMT considered that there was a commercial reality to the negotiations between Magic and L’Oréal and such negotiations had gone beyond testing the waters and that Magic had failed to disclose inside information to the public as soon as reasonably practicable (Note 4). \r\n\nIn the MMT’s view, Magic’s breach of the disclosure requirements was due to the fact that its directors were not informed in a timely manner of all information relevant to the determination of whether it was necessary to make disclosure about the potential acquisition by L’Oréal to the public.\r\n\nThe MMT hence found that Tang and Cheng had failed to carry out their functions as the company’s chairman and company secretary which resulted in Magic’s breach of the corporate disclosure requirements.  It also found that the five directors had failed to take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards existed within Magic to prevent it from breaching its disclosure obligation. \r\n\nThe MMT will hold a hearing on the making of the consequential orders on 25 April 2020.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- The proceedings were brought by the Securities and

1).\r\n\nMr Wat Hin Pong, a former RO and ex-head of dealing of China Rise, has also been suspended for seven months from 30 March 2020 to 29 October 2020 (Note 2).\r\n\nThe SFC’s disciplinary action against Shiu follows his criminal conviction in 2017 for illegal short selling and the SFC’s sanction against China Rise over its internal control failures and regulatory breaches related to short selling and cross trades between January and May 2014 (Note 3).\r\n\nThe SFC’s investigation revealed that Shiu placed 199 illegal short selling orders involving 21 listed securities through his personal account and the discretionary account of a client during the material time but concealed them from China Rise and the client.\r\n\nShiu also took advantage of the discretionary power granted to him by the client and conducted nine pairs of cross trades in eight listed securities between his personal account and the client’s account without the client’s knowledge.  Eight out of the nine pairs of cross trades were executed at a price to Shiu’s advantage but to the client’s detriment when compared with the nominal price of the relevant shares (Note 4).\r\n\nThe SFC further found that Shiu had failed to:\r\n\n\t- obtain proper approval for his personal dealings, short sales and cross trades as required by China Rise’s internal policies;\r\n\n\t- avoid conflict of interest and take steps to ensure fair treatment of the client in operating the client’s discretionary account; and\r\n\n\t- report cross trades to The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on four occasions as required by the Rules of the Exchange.\r\n\nWat, responsible for monitoring employee dealings and supervising the operation of discretionary accounts at the material time, routinely approved Shiu’s transactions without making any inquiries nor checking whether there were any irregularities.\r\n\nAlthough Wat issued a warning letter to Shiu on behalf of China Rise in early April 2014 following enquiries by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited on some of Shiu’s short sales, he continued to rubber-stamp Shiu’s personal dealings.  As a result, Shiu was able to continue to conduct illegal short selling in April and May 2014.\r\n\nThe SFC found that Wat was derelict in his duties.  Specifically, he had failed to:\r\n\n\t- detect and prevent illegal short selling in relation to Shiu by approving his orders without realising they were uncovered;\r\n\n\t- take any steps to ascertain whether Shiu had disclosed his interest to and obtained consent from the client as required by China Rise’s internal policy before approving Shiu’s cross trades; and\r\n\n\t- review the trading activities in Shiu’s account and the client’s account properly.\r\n\nThe SFC considers that Shiu and Wat had failed to discharge their duties as members of China Rise’s senior management, and their failures contributed to the breakdown in China Rise’s internal controls in relation to the monitoring of employee dealings, supervision of discretionary accounts, and avoidance of conflicts of interest, jeopardising China Rise’s ability to act in the best interest of its clients and market integrity (Note 5).\r\n\nIn deciding the sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances of the case, including:\r\n\n\t- Shiu’s exploitation of China Rise’s lax internal controls for his own benefit and abuse of the trust that his client placed upon him;\r\n\n\t- Shiu’s conduct was dishonest, contrary to the best interest of the client and market integrity;\r\n\n\t- Shiu’s guilty plea to illegal short selling and the court’s fine against him;\r\n\n\t- the cooperation of Shiu and Wat with the SFC in accepting the disciplinary action and their otherwise clean disciplinary

director of Long Success International (Holdings) Limited (Long Success), Mr Victor Ng, the company's former non-executive director Mr Zhang Chi, and three former independent non-executive directors, Mr Winfield Ng Kwok Chu, Mr Robert Ng Chau Tung and Mr Tse Ching Leung (Notes 1 to 4).\r\n\nThey were disqualified from being a director or being involved in the management of any listed or unlisted corporation in Hong Kong, without leave of the court, for a period of two to five years effective from 22 April 2020 (Notes 5 & 6).\r\n\nThe orders were made by the Honourable Mr Justice Coleman after all of them admitted that they were in breach of their fiduciary duties and common law duties to act in the interest of Long Success and/or to exercise due and reasonable skill, care and diligence in the course of acting as directors of the company.\r\n\nIn particular, they admitted that they neglected or omitted to exercise their duties as directors of Long Success and had allowed Mr Wong Kam Leong, former chairman and executive director, to exercise domination and control of the affairs of the company and of its board of directors for his personal advantage or other ulterior purposes.\r\n\nThey also admitted that there was no or no effective system of internal controls in place to prevent the above from occurring.\r\n\nThe SFC's investigation found that Wong, on behalf of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Long Success, acquired a 51% equity interest in Jining Gangning Paper Co, Ltd (Jining Gangning) for HK$190 million in 2009 (Acquisition) (Note 7).\r\n\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, Mr Chook Hong Shee, the seller, provided a profit guarantee that he would compensate Long Success if Jining Gangning failed to achieve a profit after tax of RMB60 million or recorded a loss for each of the two years ended 31 December 2010 and 2011, respectively.  Jining Gangning failed to achieve the agreed profit in both years.\r\n\nBetween March 2011 and March 2012, Wong, on behalf of Long Success, signed three confirmation letters with Chook whereby it was agreed, amongst other things, that payment of the profit guarantee owed by him would be deferred.\r\n\nIn June 2012, Wong, on behalf of Long Success, signed another confirmation letter whereby it was agreed that Long Success would forfeit the profit guarantee amount of HK$30.1 million owed by Chook, but the decision to forfeit the profit guarantee was not approved by the board of directors of Long Success at the material time.\r\n\nThe SFC considered that there was no objective, rational or commercial reason for Long Success to agree to the terms of the confirmation letters which were plainly to the company's financial detriment.  The harm to Long Success was compounded by its adverse financial position at the material time.\r\n\nThe SFC's proceedings against other former directors of Long Success are ongoing.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Long Success was listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) since 17 August 2000 until its listing status was cancelled by the SEHK with effect from 19 October 2016.  The company was principally engaged in paper manufacturing, biodegradable materials manufacturing, gaming and money lending services at the material time.  Victor Ng, who was formerly known as Wu Shaohong, was an executive director and vice chairman of Long Success from 15 December 2011 to 15 August 2012.  Zhang was non-executive director from 18 January 2010 to 29 April 2011.  Winfield Ng and Robert Ng were independent non-executive directors from 3 January 2006 to 6 October 2012, while Tse was independent non-executive director from 1 September 2009 to 15 January 2013.\r\n\n\t- The SFC commenced proceedings under section 214 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) against 13 former directors of Long Success in May 2018.  The SFC sought orders that these former directors be disqualified from being directors or being involved in the management of any listed or unlisted corporation in Hong Kong.\r\n\n\t- Under section 214 of the SFO, the court may make an order disqualifying a person from being a company director or being involved, directly or indirectly, in the management of any corporation for up to 15 years, if the person is found to be wholly or partly responsible for the company's affairs having been conducted in a manner, among other things, involving defalcation, fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or its members; resulting in its members or any part of its members not having been given all the information with respect to its business or affairs that they might reasonably expect; or unfairly prejudicial to its members or any part of its members.\r\n\n\t- The orders were made following the Court's approval that the proceedings could be disposed of by the way of Carecraft procedure which requires the submission of an agreed statement of facts upon which the Court will determine the appropriate orders to be made.\r\n\n\t- Victor Ng is disqualified from being a director or being involved in the management of any listed or unlisted corporation in Hong Kong for five years, Winfield Ng and Robert Ng are each disqualified for 30 months, while Tse and Zhang are each disqualified for two years.  Certain non-listed, private companies were excluded from the disqualification orders against Winfield Ng and Tse.\r\n\n\t- The judgment is available on the Judiciary's website (Court Reference: HCMP667/2018).\r\n\n\t- Glory Smile Enterprises Limited is the

Securities Hong Kong Limited (UBS Securities Hong Kong) to act as a sponsor for listing applications on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK).\r\n\nThe licence, which allows UBS Securities Hong Kong to act as a sponsor, was suspended for one year as part of the SFC's disciplinary action against UBS AG and UBS Securities Hong Kong (collectively, UBS) when they were sanctioned on 14 March 2019 for their failures to discharge their obligations as one of the joint sponsors of three listing applications (Note 1).\r\n\nAs agreed, UBS has engaged and cooperated with an independent reviewer to review its policies, procedures and practices in relation to the conduct of its sponsorship business (relevant area) (Note 2).\r\n\nThe reviewer conducted a 10-month review of UBS's enhanced governance processes from the acceptance of a sponsorship mandate to the listing of a listing applicant and concluded that UBS's governance and control processes applicable to the relevant area are generally well-designed, and that its assessment took account of a number of key controls, including:\r\n\n\t- a framework of processes, reviews, governance and oversight within the first line of defense to support the transaction team's compliance in the relevant area and to enable effective management oversight;\r\n\n\t- policies setting out specific responsibilities for dedicated first line of defense control functions of the sponsor business with respect to quality assurance, control monitoring and testing, as well as issue reporting and escalation, to ensure compliance with internal and regulatory requirements and expectations in the execution of listings;\r\n\n\t- adequate and appropriate forums for escalation of material issues identified across the entire deal cycle for discussion with management senior to the sponsor principal (including managers-in-charge) on a specific mandate;\r\n\n\t- adequate involvement of the independent second line of defence, ie, the compliance and operational risk functions; and\r\n\n\t- an audit programme designed and executed by internal audit as the third line of defense, which is adequate to sufficiently discharge their responsibility and perform annual assessments to ensure that both UBS and its systems and controls remain effective and compliant with the relevant regulatory requirements.\r\n\nAs part of the review, the reviewer also looked at UBS's sponsor work in its two most recent listing applications, which were completed in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  UBS was found to have implemented the abovementioned controls in the two listing applications and performed adequate and effective due diligence in discharging its sponsor responsibilities as required by the relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\r\n\nIn arriving at the decision to lift the suspension, the SFC has assessed the reviewer's findings of UBS, including obtaining from the reviewer the supporting documents for its findings, as well as seeking from the reviewer explanations for its conclusions about the adequacy and effectiveness of UBS's governance framework and control processes.\r\n\nThe SFC would like to make clear that the standards assessed in the case of UBS are equivalent to those that are expected to be adopted by all licensed sponsors.  In addition, it is important that all licensed sponsors understand that regulatory compliance ultimately depends on the ability of a firm to apply and operate these controls effectively in practice when executing all IPO mandates, which requires close management attention and supervision.\r\n\nThe SFC is satisfied after its own assessment that UBS has clear requirements and procedures in place to enable staff members to understand and properly perform their responsibilities, and that there are adequate and effective systems, controls, policies and procedures to enable compliance with all applicable Hong Kong legal and regulatory requirements in relation to its sponsor business.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Please refer to the SFC's press release dated 14 March 2019.\r\n\n\t- According to UBS, it has been enhancing its systems and controls in relation to the conduct of its sponsorship business since 2009.  Up to 2018, the areas of enhancement included the primary areas of the SFC's concerns which led to its disciplinary action against UBS on 14 March 2019, ie, UBS's practice in conducting due diligence interviews with customers and suppliers of the listing applicant, inspection of the material assets of the listing applicant, and the maintenance of records to demonstrate how UBS verified the identity of the persons interviewed, the places where interviews were conducted and the existence and general condition of the material assets inspected.","known_entities":"UBS Securities Hong Kong Limited|UBS Securities Hong Kong Limited"},{"article_body":"The Eastern Magistrates’ Court today sentenced Mr

that the three former directors had approved transactions and signed cheques giving rise to the company’s doubtful receivables amounting to about $2.55 billion, including payments to at least seven debtors which were in fact under the control of Wong and the underlying transactions for the payments were in fact not genuine commercial transactions.  They failed to carry out proper inquiries and

purchase of some of EHL's shares.\r\n\nIn analysing the power of the Court under section 214 of the SFO, the Court accepted that a compensation order can, in an appropriate case, be made irrespective of whether a respondent has received any financial benefits.  The Court, however, declined to grant the compensation order being sought in this case, and considered it should remain with the liquidators of EHL to assess the efficacy as to whether it would be beneficial to bring proceedings in the name of EHL against any party (Note 5).\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- EHL was listed on the

laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regulatory requirements in 2016 (Note 1).\r\n\nSpecifically, the SFC found that SSBL failed to:\r\n\n\t- implement adequate and effective policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing associated with third party deposits; and\r\n\n\t- establish proper internal systems and controls to monitor its clients' activities, and detect and report suspicious transactions to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU) in a timely manner.\r\n\nThe SFC's investigation revealed that between January and December 2016, SSBL failed to identify 89 per cent (ie, 164 out of 184) of the third party deposits totalling $110.1 million for its clients due to a lack of systems and procedures to review the source of funds deposited into sub-accounts that SSBL maintained with a bank.\r\n\nIn some cases where third party deposits were identified by SSBL, the clients' relationship with the third party depositors (eg, friend) and the reason for these deposits (eg, busy at work) provided by the clients failed to explain the rationale for the transfers satisfactorily.  However, SSBL did not critically evaluate these deposits and document the enquiries, as well as the reasons for approving them.\r\n\nSSBL's staff also did not have a clear and consistent understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities in the monitoring and identification of suspicious transactions.  Nor did SSBL diligently supervise and provide sufficient guidance to its staff to enable them to form suspicion or to recognise signs of money laundering or terrorist financing.\r\n\nAs such, despite the presence of red flags in some of the client activities, SSBL did not identify the suspicious transactions and make appropriate enquiries.  It was only after the SFC requested SSBL to review all client deposits and trading activities for the year of 2016 that SSBL identified 31 suspicious transactions and reported them to JFIU.\r\n\nThe SFC is of the view that SSBL's conduct was in breach of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing and the Code of Conduct (Notes 2 & 3).\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanctions against SSBL, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- adequate and effective internal control systems are fundamental to the fitness and properness of a licensed corporation;\r\n\n\t- the necessity of a strong deterrent message that AML/CFT failures are not acceptable;\r\n\n\t- SSBL

Brokerage Company, Limited (Guosen) from re-entering the industry for 12 months from 23 June 2020 to 22 June 2021 (Note 1).\r\n\nThe disciplinary action follows the SFC’s sanctions against Guosen over its failures to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) regulatory requirements when handling third party fund deposits between November 2014 and December 2015 (Note 2).\r\n\nThe SFC found that Guosen’s breaches were attributable to Chu’s failure to discharge her duties as an RO and a member of Guosen’s senior management (Note 3). \r\n\nGuosen’s internal control deficiencies in relation to third party deposits were brought to the attention of its senior management - including Chu - by its staff in 2013.  However, Chu deemed that the matter was irrelevant to her and did not take any steps to ensure that the deficiencies were rectified.  Her inaction contributed to Guosen’s failure to put in place adequate AML/CFT internal controls during the material time.\r\n\nChu also received records of third party deposits from Guosen’s then head of settlement from time to time.  Those records showed that, contrary to Guosen’s purported policy to discourage third party deposits, it processed a significant number of third party deposits for its clients.  However, Chu did not take any action and did not escalate the matter to her supervisor or other members of Guosen’s senior management, despite the substantial amount of third party deposits received. \r\n\nApart from turning a blind eye to the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks associated with third party deposits, Chu also failed to ensure that Guosen’s staff adhered to the procedures for assessing clients’ ML/TF risks by documenting the process as required by Guosen’s compliance manual in her capacity as one of the approvers of account opening applications.\r\n\nThe SFC considers that Chu’s conduct fell short of the standard required of her as an RO for a licensed corporation. \r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including that Guosen’s regulatory breaches were serious and Chu’s otherwise clean disciplinary record. \r\n\nChu, who had applied to the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal (SFAT) for a review of the SFC’s decision, was granted leave to withdraw her application on 23 June

failures and regulatory breaches in connection with anti-money laundering, handling of third party fund transfers and placing activities, as well as detection of wash trades and late reporting (Note 1).\r\n\nThird party fund transfers\r\n\nThe SFC investigation found that, between March 2014 and March 2015, Guotai Junan failed to take reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards were put in place to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in processing 15,584 third party deposits or withdrawals for its clients, totalling approximately $37.5 billion.\r\n\nDespite red flags suggesting some of the third party fund transfers were unusual or suspicious, Guotai Junan failed to adequately monitor the activities of its clients, conduct appropriate scrutiny of the fund transfers, identify transactions that were suspicious and report them to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit in a timely manner (Note 2).\r\n\nGuotai Junan also did not ensure that its policies and procedures regarding anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) were properly and effectively implemented with respect to third party fund transfers.  Specifically, the SFC found that there were:\r\n\n\t- a number of occasions where the reasons for the third party fund transfers, the relationship between the client and the third party, and/or the identity of the third parties were not documented and identified;\r\n\n\t- inadequate guidance to its staff on the extent of enquiries they had to make with clients in relation to the third party fund transfers;\r\n\n\t- inadequate procedures requiring its money laundering reporting officer to play an active role in identifying suspicious transactions; and\r\n\n\t- inadequate communication between its operations and compliance staff to ensure effective monitoring of client activities.\r\n\nIn addition, Guotai Junan processed 5,406 third party deposits from July 2015 to June 2016 without always documenting the identity of the depositors, their relationship with the account holders, and the reasons for these third party deposits, contrary to the firm’s written policies and procedures.\r\n\nIt further failed to identify that two deposits totalling $38.2 million for a share subscription in December 2015 did not come from the relevant client but a third party, nor did it have written procedures for the identification of third party deposits until around September 2016.\r\n\nPlacing activities\r\n\nWhile acting as the placing agent for the global offering of a Hong Kong-listed company’s shares between December 2015 and January 2016, Guotai Junan failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether the clients’ subscription applications were consistent with its knowledge of their background and source of funds, and make appropriate enquiries when there were grounds for suspicion.\r\n\nIn particular, the funds used by five clients to subscribe for $28.8 million worth of the listed company’s shares were deposited by the same third party into the respective client accounts in amounts far exceeding their self-declared net worth.\r\n\nDespite such red flags, Guotai Junan did not take reasonable steps to verify the ultimate beneficial owners of the clients’ accounts and their source of funds, nor make appropriate enquiries to ascertain whether the clients were independent of the listed company.  In the end, three of the five placees, who were allotted 11% of the listed company’s shares of the total placing under the international tranche, turned out to be the listed company’s employees (Note 3).\r\n\nDetection of wash trades and reporting obligation\r\n\nThe SFC further found that Guotai Junan failed to detect 590 potential wash trades in a timely manner between January 2014 and July 2016 due to a lack of adequate written trade monitoring procedures or guidelines and technical failures of its transaction pattern monitoring system.\r\n\nHowever, despite becoming aware in July 2016 of 210 potential wash trades which could not be detected in a timely manner as a result of the system failure, Guotai Junan did not report these 210 trades to the SFC until seven months later in February 2017.\r\n\nThe above-mentioned findings led the SFC to come to the view that Guotai Junan’s conduct failed to comply with regulatory requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing, the Internal Control Guidelines and the Code of Conduct (Notes 4 & 5).\r\n\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account that:\r\n\n\t- there were multiple AML/CFT related failures and Guotai Junan was handling a substantial number or amount of third party fund transfers;\r\n\n\t- Guotai Junan’s failures in complying with AML/CFT requirements lasted for an extensive period of time, including its failure to put in place written procedures to identify third party deposits from September 2009 - when the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Guidance Note came into effect - to around September 2016;\r\n\n\t- while the failures in the transaction pattern monitoring system were primarily attributable to the third party vendor, Guotai Junan failed to detect wash trades for more than two years and around 590 potential wash trades were not detected;\r\n\n\t- the SFC has sent a clear message in previous disciplinary cases that licensed corporations are required to report misconduct to the SFC immediately upon discovery of such misconduct;\r\n\n\t- a strong message is necessary to deter similar misconduct;\r\n\n\t- Guotai Junan has taken prompt remedial measures to rectify the deficiencies in its trade monitoring system and procedures once identified, and has proactively enhanced its policies and procedures in relation to AML/CFT; and\r\n\n\t- in resolving the SFC’s concerns, Guotai Junan undertook to provide the SFC with a report prepared by an independent reviewer within 12 months confirming that all the identified concerns were properly rectified.\r\n\n\"The disciplinary action against Guotai Junan for serious systemic deficiencies and failures across its internal controls should serve as a stark reminder to licensed corporations the importance of having adequate and effective safeguards in place to mitigate the real risk of becoming a conduit to facilitate illicit activities, such as money laundering, when exposed to potentially suspicious transactions,\" said Mr Thomas Atkinson, the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement.\r\n\nEnd\r\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\t- Guotai Junan is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities.\r\n\n\t- Red flags revealed in a review of some of the fund transfers include: (i) frequent fund transfers to and from third parties that were unrelated to the client, or whose relationship with the client was unverified or difficult to verify; (ii) transactions which have no apparent legitimate purpose and/or appear not to have a commercial rationale, and/or out of the ordinary range of services normally requested of a licensed corporation; (iii) instances where the source of funds was unclear or not consistent with the client’s profile; (iv) unnecessary routing of funds from/to third parties or using the account as a conduit for transfers; and (v) large or unusual cash settlements.\r\n\n\t- Pursuant to paragraph 7

Most of the trading was undertaken on NIP's behalf by NIHK on the instructions of NIP. All relevant trades were executed on behalf of NIP on a proprietary basis. Responsibility for devising the overall strategy to be adopted on 29 March 1996 was in London.\n\nOn 29 March 1996, as part of its Australian index arbitrage operations, NIP went to an expiry in relation to its position in sold March 1996 SPI Contracts, and placed orders with ten Australian securities brokers to sell parcels of 345 individual securities worth approximately AUD$600 million in the last 30 minutes of trading on the ASX. At the close of trading on 28 March 1996, NIP had a short futures position of 10,912 sold March 1996 SPI Contracts on the SFE, being approximately 14% of total open interest in those contracts. Those contracts were cash settled by reference to the closing price of the All Ordinaries Index (All Ords) on 29 March 1996.\n\nIn addition to giving instructions to sell AUD$600 million worth of stocks, Nomura instructed one of the ten Australian securities brokers to input into the ASX Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (a computerised order-driven trading system) bid orders for the same stocks at between 5 and 20% discount to the closing price on 28 March 1996. The effect of this was that there would always be a bid order (on behalf of NIP) available to match the selling orders given by Nomura, so that the selling orders could be executed even if there were no third party buying orders, that is that in the event there were no third party buyers NIP would buy the stocks from itself at a discount. NIP's bid orders are also referred to as a \"bid basket\". The probability that NIP's bid basket would be traded was highest for the less liquid stocks. Had the selling orders been traded as anticipated by Nomura, Nomura would have purchased stock for itself at or near the close and as a consequence there would have been a greater impact on the All Ordinaries Index and in turn the settlement price of the March SPI contract.\n\nNomura also instructed two Australian futures brokers to sell March expiry SPI futures contracts during the course of the day on 29 March 1996, thus increasing Nomura short March SPI futures position by 2,607 contracts. This was a trade which would be profitable if the All Ords fell.\n\nNomura also instructed those brokers to sell June expiry SPI futures contracts during the course of the day on 29 March 1996. This was in order to hedge against the expected long position in stock which would arise from a failure to sell all of the position to third parties. NIP sold 1,040 June SPI futures contract during the day.\n\nIn the event, on 29 March 1996, the All Ords fell from a high of 2251.3 at 3:05 p.m. to 2225.6 at the close, a fall of 25.7 points. At 3:45 p.m., the All Ords stood at 2237.9 points. The index therefore fell 12.3 points in the last 15 minutes of trading during which time the NIP sale orders were being executed. Notwithstanding Nomura instructions, the ten Australian securities brokers managed to sell less than half of the AUD$600 million worth of stocks on 29 March 1996 at the market close but further sales took place after the market closed, mostly at the closing price. As a result of NIP having given both buying and selling orders in those stocks two sales involving no change of beneficial ownership (wash trades) were executed on behalf of NIP, at a discount of 15% and 20% respectively on the closing price of 28 March 1996. In addition to the costs incurred of brokerage and stamp duty of AUD$1.54 million, NIP made a loss of AUD$900,000 arising from the failure to dispose of all of the stocks on 29 March 1996 and further losses from the consequently unbalanced nature of NIP's Australian index arbitrage book. NIP made a profit of AUD$1.1 million on the expiry of the 2,607 sold March SPI futures contracts entered into on 29 March 1996.\n\nThis trading, to the extent conducted on behalf of NIP by NIHK, was of concern to the SFC because NIHK is registered by it. While the authorities in Australia, London and Hong Kong have each conducted their own investigation under their respective legal powers, they have closely co-operated with each other and exchanged the information that they gathered and that had been voluntarily supplied by Nomura.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission instituted civil legal proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia alleging that the conduct of NIP, but not NIHK or any individuals, had contravened Sections 995, 998 and 1260 of the Corporate Law, which deal with misleading and deceptive dealing in securities (S.995) and false or misleading appearance of active trading in securities (S.998) and in future contracts (S.1260). Judgment was delivered on 10 December 1998. The Federal Court found that: NIP's conduct in giving instructions to sell a large volume of stocks and the placement of bid basket at well below market levels meant that the sell order which hit the bids in the bid basket in respect of the 2 stocks were wash trades and contravened Section 998. The Court further found that the combined operation of the sell orders and the placing of the bid basket constituted conduct intended to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in illiquid securities in contravention Section 998. NIP's measures were intended to determine the closing price of illiquid securities on the expiry date for future contracts and have influence the cash settlement price of futures contracts going to expiry and consequently created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for dealings in a futures contract on a futures market in contravention of Section 1260.\n\nThe SFC instituted disciplinary proceedings against NIHK and certain individuals for misconduct and on the basis that their fitness and propriety to be registered as securities and futures representatives had been impugned. Nomura challenged the timing of these disciplinary proceedings in the High Court of Hong Kong by way of judicial review. In December 1997, the High Court granted Nomura's application to stay the disciplinary proceeding thereby temporarily preventing the SFC from proceeding. In April 1998, the SFC successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal who unanimously allowed its appeal deciding that NIHK had not established sufficient evidence of a real risk of serious prejudice. NIHK sought leave to appeal this decision to the Court of Final Appeal. The Court, on 21 October 1998, dismissed the application and awarded costs to the SFC.\n\nWhilst NIHK understands that NIP is giving consideration to the possibility of an appeal against the decision of the Federal Court in Australia against NIP, NIHK has taken account of this decision. NIHK acknowledges that the SFC had wholly legitimate concerns about the appropriateness of its conduct. NIHK has expressed deep regret that it did not more actively pursue an agreed outcome with the SFC. NIHK has confirmed that it has taken steps to ensure that it does not knowingly execute wash trades with the intention of depressing, raising or stabilizing the market price of any securities and does not knowingly allow its staff to engage in conduct in any market which would not meet Hong Kong standards of fitness and properness.\n\nThe SFC has severely publicly reprimanded NIHK for failing adequately to supervise the two employees who instructed the ten Australian securities brokers on 29 March 1996 and for allowing NIHK to be involved in conduct on behalf of NIP which it knew or should have known was likely to mislead or deceive participants in the Australian markets. The SFC has also suspended Mr. Duncan Moss, one of the employees concerned, for a period of 12 months for his misconduct. NIHK has agreed to pay the SFC's costs in full.","known_entities":"Nomura International (Hong Kong) Limited|Nomura International (Hong Kong) Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission announced that it had today successfully prosecuted Mr Lai Yiu Keung (Lai), a director of Styland Holdings Limited (Styland), under the Securities (Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance for failing to report, on four occasions during the period March and April 1998, his change of interest in the shares of Styland resulting from his disposal of a total of 7 million shares.\n\nMs Polly Lo, a Magistrate at Western Magistracy, fined Lai a total of $16,000 for his breaches and ordered him to pay costs totalling $4,700 to the SFC.","known_entities":"Lai Yiu Keung|Yiu Keung Lai"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission announced that on 22 December 1998 it had successfully prosecuted Mr Yeung Kwok Fan (Yeung), Chairman and Managing Director of Wah Lee Resources Holdings Limited (Wah Lee), under the Securities (Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance for failing to report his change of interests in the shares of Wah Lee on four occasions.

The SFC's inquiry related to matters that occurred prior to the change of ownership. The inquiry also concerned the conduct of the then management with respect to the affairs of a related finance company, Cheerful Finance Company Limited.\n\nFollowing the collapse of another unrelated securities firm in January 1998 a significant number of Cheerful Securities Limited's clients, who also maintained margin financing accounts at Cheerful Finance Company Limited, requested that their stock holdings with the finance company be transferred to Cheerful Securities Limited. The clients shares had been pledged to financial institutions by the finance company and because of cash flow problems at the finance company the requests were not processed. Notwithstanding this situation, Cheerful Securities Limited issued 'securities deposit\" receipts to clients acknowledging that their securities had been received and deposited into their accounts with Cheerful Securities Limited. It was only following a substantial cash injection into the finance company by the new shareholders that clients shares could be redeemed.\n\nIn respect of Cheerful Securities Limited, the SFC found that there were serious deficiencies in its internal control systems and procedures, resulting in numerous breaches of the SFC's Code of Conduct. The deficiencies were the result of senior management's failure to discharge its management responsibilities and to thereby ensure the integrity of Cheerful Securities Limited's day to day operations during the period from January to March 1998. The SFC found that {X1}, the then Chairman of the Cheerful Group of companies and a director of Cheerful Securities Limited and Cheerful Finance Company Limited, was primarily responsible for the actions of these companies and the deficiencies identified. The SFC also found that {X2} who held the title of managing director and who was registered as a dealing director of Cheerful Securities Limited, should have assumed responsibility for the day to day operations of the company, but had failed to properly carry out his responsibilities in this regard during the relevant period.\n\nIn view of these findings, the SFC has:\n\nreprimanded {X1}. Had {X1} been registered with the SFC a revocation would have been appropriate.\n\nreprimanded {X2}. In deciding upon this action the SFC took into account that {X2} was not a director of Cheerful Finance Company Limited, the lesser role he played in the events, is no longer an employee or officer of Cheerful Securities Limited and that he was closely involved in efforts to resolve the financial difficulties of Cheerful Securities Limited in early 1998.\n\n\n\nAs the deficiencies identified were associated with the previous controlling shareholders and management and as the new controlling shareholders and management have taken immediate and significant steps to remedy the situation, including the appointment of a leading firm of accountants to thoroughly review their operations, the SFC believes that further action against the registered entities is not necessary. \n\nAn SFC spokesman said that the SFC will not tolerate senior management of a registered entity failing to discharge their management responsibilities thereby putting the integrity of their firms at risk.","known_entities":"Cheerful Securities Limited|{X1}\t (Note 1)|{X2}\t (Note 1)|Cheerful Securities Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today the result of its inquiry into the operations of Cheerful Commodities Company Limited (as it was formerly known) covering the period January 1995 to October 1997. \n\nIn March 1998 Cheerful Commodities Company Limited was sold and became known as Celestial Commodities Limited.

The market value of clients' securities utilised for the purposes reached HK$11.7 million and included securities belonging to both cash and margin clients.

The establishment, maintenance and enforcement of effective compliance procedures covering legal and regulatory requirements is a fundamental control in the effective management and supervision of a registered/licensed entity’s business. Management must assume full responsibility for the entity’s operations including the development, implementation and ongoing effectiveness of the internal controls and adherence thereto by its directors and employees. A failure in this regard reflects badly on the way an entity is structured and operated and calls into question the continuing fitness and properness of both the entity and its directors.","known_entities":"Tse's Forex Investment Company Limited|Tse's Securities Limited|{X1}\t (Note 1)|{X1}\t (Note 1)|{X2}\t (Note 1)|{X3}\t (Note 1)|Tse's Forex Investment Company Limited|Tse's Securities Limited"},{"article_body":"The Securities and Futures Commission (\"SFC\") and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the \"Exchange\") jointly announce today that they have taken action against ASG Brokerage Limited (\"ASG\"), a Securities Dealer and a Member of the Exchange.

The Disciplinary Committee found a charge against each of Ping On, Mr Chu, {X} and Mr Leung for breach of the Rules of the Exchange proved.\n\nThe substance of the charge proved against Ping On, Mr Chu, {X} and Mr Leung was that during the period 1 December 1996 to 31 March 1997, Ping On had failed to have satisfactory internal control procedures, resulting that:-\n\n(i) Mr Chu had engaged in illegal short-selling activities through a nominee account in Ping On and had also engaged in in-house manual cross trades for clients which were intended to delay settlement of trades for clients' benefit;\n\n(ii) Mr Leung had engaged in illegal short-selling activities through his nominee account in Ping On and had also engaged in trading malpractices by diverting orders which had been executed for clients to his nominee account in Ping On, thus depriving them from the benefit of these trades;\n\n(iii) Five employees of Ping On had conducted dealing activities without being registered; and\n\n(iv) Clients of Ping On had engaged in illegal short-selling activities.\n\n Mr Chu was the person at Ping On directly responsible for the day to day operations and management of Ping On. The failings identified were therefore directly attributable to him. His illegal short-selling activities and the use of nominee account and in-house manual cross trades further increased the gravity with which the Exchange viewed his misconduct.\n\n {X} and Mr Chu were responsible to ensure that proper internal controls and procedures were developed and implemented at Ping On and that staff were properly supervised and registered. The Exchange found that both of them seriously failed to carry out their responsibilities in this respect.\n\nHaving considered that following an inspection of the business of Ping On by the Exchange, Ping On had appointed an independent firm of accountants to review its operations and report to the Exchange and the Exchange was satisfied that the deficiencies identified had been rectified, the Disciplinary Committee resolved that a penalty of public censure plus a fine of HK$40,000 be imposed on Ping On, a penalty of public censure plus a fine of HK$30,000 be imposed on Mr Chu, a penalty of public censure plus a fine of HK$10,000 be imposed on {X} and a penalty of public censure plus a fine of HK$4,000 be imposed on Mr Leung.

The Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Exchange”) jointly announce today that they have taken action against Prudential-Bache Securities (Hong Kong) Limited (“Prudential”) and its Managing Director, {X1}. Both Prudential and {X1} are registered securities dealers under the Securities Ordinance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action stems from an investigation by the SFC in which the SFC found that during the period from 15th December 1997 to 3rd July 1998, a former dealer's representative of Prudential, who was subsequently dismissed, had engaged in extensive short selling via a personal account he maintained with Prudential. The SFC investigation revealed that Prudential had inadequate internal controls and failed to implement an appropriate system for deterring and detecting intra day short selling by its staff. The SFC therefore decided to publicly reprimand Prudential and {X1}.\n\nThe Disciplinary Committee of the Exchange (the \"Disciplinary Committee\") has also decided to publicly censure Prudential and {X1} and fine Prudential HK$30,000 and {X1} HK$20,000.\n\nIn deciding on this course of action the SFC and the Disciplinary Committee took into account that:\n\nthere is no evidence that clients of Prudential or the general public were affected or disadvantaged;\n\nthe short sales in question involved relatively small amounts and were all on the former dealer's representative's personal account;\n\nPrudential and {X1} had fully co-operated with and assisted in the SFC's enquiry;\n\nthis is the first such regulatory action taken against each of Prudential and {X1};\n\nPrudential and {X1} have taken steps to enhance their internal control and supervisory procedures; and\n\nPrudential has significantly enhanced its written compliance policies and monitoring procedures, including those covering staff dealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The SFC and the Exchange jointly announce today that they have taken action against {X2} trading as Lucky Company, a Securities Dealer and a Member of the Exchange, and against {X3} and {X4}, both dealer's representatives of Lucky Company and registered persons of the Exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action stemmed from an inquiry covering the period January 1997 to March 1997 in which it was found that:\n\nemployees and clients of Lucky Company had engaged in illegal short selling activities;\n\nuse of nominee accounts by some employees to engage in their own trading;\n\nclient priority was not observed as employees' own dealing were not the subject of scrutinised approval by management; and\n\ninadequate audit trails to detect and deter trading malpractices thereby exposing its clients and itself to unnecessary risks and potentially damaging the integrity of the securities markets of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nThe management of Lucky Company was responsible for the deficiencies identified above in that they failed to properly supervise employees and failed to develop and implement proper internal control procedures in Lucky Company to protect its operations, its clients and the integrity of the market.\n\n{X2} had delegated most of the day to day operation of the business to staff of Lucky Company but had failed to ensure that such staff carried out their responsibilities properly. As the sole proprietor of Lucky Company, {X2} bears ultimate responsibilities for the above failings.\n\n{X3}, a dealer's representative of Lucky Company, had used a nominee account to conduct his own trading. He also failed to monitor the account of a client to ensure that the client did not short sell.\n\n{X4}, a dealer's representative of Lucky Company, had used a nominee account to conduct his own trading. He had conducted internal manual cross trades between his nominee account and the accounts of other clients of Lucky Company without first disclosing his interest in the transactions to those clients in breach of Clause 10 of Code of Conduct for persons registered with the SFC. There is, however, no evidence that any client was disadvantaged.\n\nAs a result of the above findings, {X2} has agreed to take the following remedial actions:\n\n{X2} has now arranged for a company to be incorporated to take over the securities dealing business of Lucky Company;\n\n{X2} will appoint an independent Dealing Director for the incorporated company; and\n\n{X2} has taken remedial actions to remedy the failings identified in the SFC's and Exchange's investigation. He has also engaged an independent firm of accountants to perform a review of the systems and internal control procedures of his business and to report the findings to the Exchange and SFC. He has agreed to implement any recommendations made in the accountants' report to the satisfaction of the Exchange and SFC.\n\n\n\nThe SFC's decision to publicly reprimand {X2} took into account that {X2} has agreed to take and implement the above remedial actions. The SFC also decided that {X3}'s and{X4}'s conduct warranted a public reprimand. In addition, the Disciplinary Committee has decided to publicly censure {X2}, {X3} and {X4} and fine {X2} HK$50,000, {X3} HK$4,000 and {X4} HK$6,000. The Disciplinary Committee also resolved to revoke {X4}'s and {X3}'s registration with the Exchange should they be found guilty of any misconduct within the next 24 months.","known_entities":"Lucky Company|Prudential-Bache Securities (Hong Kong) Limited|{X1}\t (Note 1)|{X2}\t (Note 1)|{X3}\t (Note 1)|{X4}\t (Note 1)|Prudential-Bache Securities (Hong Kong) Limited|Lucky Company|Prudential Brokerage Limited"}]
